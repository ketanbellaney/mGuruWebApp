Gauri
saw
a
scarecrow
look
down
at
its
clothes.
&nbsp;
“Why
do
we
always
have
to
wear
these
tattered
old
clothes?”
said
a
scarecrow
with
a
sigh.
“I
wish
we
had
something
pretty
to
wear!”
&nbsp;
“Yes,
me
too!”
said
another.
The
scarecrows
looked
around
the
field.
Suddenly,
one
of
them
called
out,
“Hey,
look
at
those
lovely
clothes
flapping
in
the
breeze.
Why
don’t
we
wear
those?”
&nbsp;
“Oo-oo!
These
clothes
are
so
pretty.
Let
us
try
them
on!”
said
another.

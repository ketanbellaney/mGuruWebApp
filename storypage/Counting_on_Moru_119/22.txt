It
was
dark
and
the
school
had
no
lights.
“You
have
to
go
home
now,
Moru,
but
you
can
come
back
tomorrow,”
said
the
teacher.
“But
can
you
come
when
the
children
are
here
please?”
Next
day,
soon
after
school
started,
Moru
came.
The
children
were
surprised
to
see
him
and
a
little
scared.


By
now
Moru
was
famous
as
a
‘dada’
of
the
neighbourhood.
“I
have
someone
to
help
me
now,”
said
the
teacher.
He
put
Moru
with
the
younger
children.
There
were
books
in
which
the
children
were
supposed
to
write.

“Please,
can
you
help
the
children
arrange
these
numbers
in
ascending
and
descending
order?”
The
little
kids
scrambled
around
Moru;
they
were
amazed
that
a
tough
fellow
like
Moru
knew
so
much.

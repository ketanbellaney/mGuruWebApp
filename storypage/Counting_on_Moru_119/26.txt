There
was
Moru.
His
head
was
down,
and
he
was
looking
carefully
into
his
notebook.
There
was
a
frown
of
concentration
on
his
forehead
and
a
deep
look
of
absorption
in
his
eyes.
He
was
busy
solving
complicated
mathematics
problems
along
with
all
the
other
children
of
his
age.


The
teacher
looked
out
too,
and
he
smiled
his
soft
warm
smile
at
Moru's
mother.
She
smiled
back
happily.
Moru
was
in
school
again.


This
time
he
was
learning
more
and
more.
And
most
importantly,
this
time
he
was
loving
it.

Moru
liked
to
climb
trees
and
steal
raw
mangoes.
He
would
creep
along
the
branch
pretending
to
be
a
cheetah
in
a
deep
dark
jungle.
He
enjoyed
catching
insects
-
the
blue
green
bottle
fly
with
the
big
shiny
head,
the
thin
and
crisp
grasshopper,
and
the
yellow
butterfly
whose
colour
came
off
like
powder
on
his
fingers.&nbsp;Moru
loved
flying&nbsp;kites,
the
higher
the
better.
He
would
climb
to
the
tallest
terrace
to
get
his
kite
to
soar
far
above
the
clouds
like
a
brilliant
eagle
trying
to
reach
the
sun.

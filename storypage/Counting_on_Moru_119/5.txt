Moru
liked
going
to
school
because
many
of
his
friends
went
too.
He
liked
getting
up
in
the
morning
and
having
somewhere
to
go.
He
liked
the
big
playground
but
he
did
not
like
going
to
class.


He
did
not
like
the
teacher.
He
felt
trapped
in
the
room.&nbsp;The
children
could
not
ask
questions,
they
could
not
move
around
and
they
could
not
speak
when
they
wanted
to
say
things.
The
teacher
was
bad-tempered.
Moru
felt
that
the
teacher
did
not
like
the
children
at
all.
Maybe
he
did
not
even
like
being
a
teacher
or
coming
to
a
school.
In
any
case,
children
did
not
like
the
teacher
either.

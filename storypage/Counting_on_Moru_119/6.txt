Every
morning,
the
teacher
wrote
things
on
the
blackboard.
In
a
loud
voice,
he
told
the
children
to
copy
it
down
on
their
slates.
Then
he
would
go
outside.
If
the
boys
could
copy
his
things
from
the
blackboard
nicely,
the
teacher
looked
at
it.
If
they
could
not
do
it,
the
teacher
got
angry.
When
he
was
angry,
he
would
call
the
children
names
and
if
he
got
very
angry
he
would
hit
them
hard.

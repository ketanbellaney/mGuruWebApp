He
would
go
to
the
market
and
give
the
vegetable
sellers
a
hard
time.
He
would
gang
up
with
other
children
like
him
who
had
left
school
and
tease
and
taunt
the
children
who
were
going
to
school.


He
would
make
paper
airplanes
out
of
the
school
notebooks
of
his
friends.
He
would
go
up
on
the
terrace
and
hit
unsuspecting
people
who
were
passing
by
with
pellets
from
his
sling.

Moru
liked
numbers.
Number
1
looked
thin
and
lonely;
100
was
fat
and
wealthy.
How
graceful
9
was,
even
more
so
when
she
stood
next
to
1
and
became
19.&nbsp;

Numbers
were
like
an
unending
staircase.
Moru
imagined
climbing
them
one
by
one
by
one,
racing
up,
sometimes
two,
sometimes
three
or
four
or
more
steps
at
a
time.

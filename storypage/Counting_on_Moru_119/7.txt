One
day,
the
teacher
wrote
some
sums
on
the
board.
The
sums
were
easy
but
they
were
boring.
Moru
did
not
feel
like
doing
them
and
he
did
not
have
a
slate.
His
slate
had
broken
and
his
mother
did
not
have
the
money
to
buy
a
new
one.


Instead
he
counted
the
hundreds
of
ants
that
were
climbing
the
wall.
He
looked
at
the
tree
outside
and
noticed
that
the
leaves
were
perfect.
Perfect
leaves
had
perfect
shadows.
In
his
mind,
Moru
counted
how
many
broken
bricks
there
were
along
the
schoolâ€™s
compound
wall.
He
calculated
that
if
each
brick
costed
five
rupees
it
would
take
more
than
one
thousand
rupees
to
fill
in
all
the
gaps
and
broken
spaces
in
the
wall.

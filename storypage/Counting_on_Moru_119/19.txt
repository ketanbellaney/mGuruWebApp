The
next
day,
Moru
waited
till
school
was
over
and
all
the
children
had
left.
The
teacher
was
alone.
Moru
went
in
quietly
and
stood
by
the
door.
The
school
seemed
ghostly
when
all
the
noise
and
laughter
and
shouting
was
gone.


The
teacher
looked
up
and
said,
“Good
you
have
come.
I
need
your
help.”
Moru
was
curious.
What
kind
of
help
could
the
teacher
need?
He
had
many,
many
children
in
his
school
to
help
him.
In
a
very
matter
of
fact
kind
of
voice
the
teacher
said,
“Can
you
help
me
sort
out
the
books?”

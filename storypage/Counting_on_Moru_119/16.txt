A
few
days
later,
the
teacher
was
passing
by.
He
was
carrying
a
huge
bag.
The
bag
was
very
heavy.
The
teacher
was
having
a
difficult
time.
Moru
scratched
his
head.
The
teacher
passed
him
by
slowly.

Moru
thought
and
then
he
ran
behind
the
teacher.
Without
saying
anything,
he
took
hold
of
one
end
of
the
bag.
The
teacher
was
relieved
and
together
they
were
able
to
get
the
heavy
load
to
the
school
quickly.

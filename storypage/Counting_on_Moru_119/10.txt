The
next
morning,
Moru's
mother
woke
him
up
in
time
for
school.
But
Moru
would
not
get
up.
He
lay
on
the
narrow
bed
with
his
eyes
tightly
shut.&nbsp;

Next
day
it
was
the
same
story,
and
the
next
day
and
the
next.
No
one
could
persuade
Moru
to
go
back
to
school.
One
week
passed
and
then
one
month.
Moru
sat
on
the
wall
in
front
of
his
house.

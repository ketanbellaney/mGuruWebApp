Moru
continued
softly,
"Even
if
I
had
a
slate
I
won't
do
the
sums
because
I
don't
want
to."
The
teacher
was
furious.
He
slapped
Moru.
Moru's
cheek
burned
bright
red.
Sudden
hot
tears
sprang
into
his
eyes.
He
stood
up
and
ran
out
of
the
room,
down
the
verandah,
across
the
dusty
playground,
through
the
broken
gate
and
away.

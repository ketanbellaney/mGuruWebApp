She
looked
up
on
the
mango
tree,
the
leaves
rustled
in
the
breeze
but
there
was
no
Moru
on
the
branches.
She
went
to
the
market
but
all
the
vegetable
sellers
were
selling
their
vegetables
without
being
bothered
by
the
usual
gang
of
boys.


Finally,
she
walked
down
the
lane
and
happened
to
look
into
the
window
of
the
school.

Moru
sat
on
the
floor.
The
books
were
all
around
him.
There
were
so
many
storybooks.


He
put
the
animal
ones
together.
The
leopard
storybook
would
feel
more
comfortable
with
the
elephants
and
camels.
The
fairytales
could
sit
with
the
stories
about
gods
and
goddesses.
The
adventure
stories
sat
on
their
own.
Or
maybe
they
should
go
with
the
heroes
and
famous
people?

Moru
made
the
children
stand
in
a
line
-
the
smallest
children
at
one
end
and
the
tallest
ones
at
the
other
end.
He
gave
them
numbers
to
hold.
Now
it
was
easy.
Just
like
with
short
children
and
tall
children,
it
is
easy
to
know
who
to
put
where,
it
was
the
same
with
the
numbers.


Every
day
Moru
would
come
for
a
little
while
and
every
day
the
teacher
would
give
him
a
bigger
and
bigger
task
to
do.
Every
day
he
found
his
love
for
numbers
was
getting
stronger
and
every
day
his
excitement
and
skill
was
being
absorbed
by
the
little
children.

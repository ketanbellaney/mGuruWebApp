The
teacher
was
passing
by.
Moru
looked
at
the
teacher.
The
teacher
looked
at
Moru
Neither
smiled
and
neither
frowned.


The
next
day,
at
the
same
time
and
the
same
place,
Moru
looked
down
from
the
wall.
The
teacher
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled.
It
was
a
small
smile.
Moru
jumped
from
the
wall
and
ran
away.

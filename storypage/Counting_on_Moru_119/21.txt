Then
came
the
books
with
numbers.
Moru's
eyes
and
fingers
slowed
down.
The
fat
numbers
danced
with
the
thin
ones.
Two
digits
balanced
one
on
top
of
the
other
like
an
unsteady
building
still
waiting
for
the
base
to
be
filled.
The
multiplication
sums
looked
short
and
squat
and
got
fatter
and
fatter
at
the
bottom
as
the
numbers
got
bigger.


Division
was
just
the
opposite.You
began
with
a
lot
and
then
if
you
were
careful,
you
worked
it
down
to
create
a
long
thin
graceful
tail.
If
you
were
lucky
there
would
be
nothing
left.
One
by
one
all
the
numbers
and
their
tricks
came
back
to
Moru.

Sometimes
he
would
disappear
into
the
market
for
hours.
He
would
try
to
fly
his
kite
from
the
terrace
but
it
was
no
fun
because
the
sky
was
empty.&nbsp;

His
mother
scolded
him,
his
brother
teased
him,
his
grandmother
begged
him,
his
uncle
bribed
him
and
his
friends
coaxed
him.
But
nobody
could
persuade
him
to
return
to
school.

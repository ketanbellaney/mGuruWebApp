“Moru!”
scolded
the
teacher.
“Why
are
you
not
doing
anything?”


Moru
looked
blank.
“Where
is
your
slate?
Why
haven’t
you
brought
one
to
school?”
shouted
the
teacher.
Moru
could
see
that
the
teacher
was
angry
with
him.
Moru
replied,
“My
old
slate
broke
and
I
don’t
have
the
money
to
buy
a
new
one.”
The
teacher
was
angry
and
gave
Moru
a
sharp
tap
with
the
stick
in
his
hand.

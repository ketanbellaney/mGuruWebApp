When
he
was
tired,
he
saw
himself
sliding
down
the
banister
with
the
numbers
waving
at
him.&nbsp;


Unlike
rice
at
lunchtime,
which
often
finished
before
anyone
was
even
half
full,
unlike
friends
who
had
to
go
home
just
as
soon
as
the
game
was
starting
to
be
fun,
numbers
were
always
there.
Unending
and
infinitely
fun,
to
be
juggled,
sorted,
matched,
shared,
laid
out
in
a
row,
thrown
away,
put
together
and
taken
apart.

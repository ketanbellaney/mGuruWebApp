Place
the
ball
(the
earth)
directly
in
the
path
of
the
torch
beam
(sunlight),
so
that
India
is
facing
the
sun.
Turn
the
ball
around
slowly.
What
do
you
see?
When
India
is
facing
the
sun,
the
Americas
are
in
darkness.


As
India
begins
to
turn
away
from
the
sun,
Europe
and
Africa
come
into
the
‘sunlight’.
Then,
as
the
‘earth’
continues
to
turn,
the
Americas
come
into
the
light
and
India
becomes
dark.


Keep
turning
the
ball
till
India
faces
the
sun
again.&nbsp;This
is
what
happens
every
time
the
earth
turns
around
on
its
axis.
During
each
rotation,
India
(and
every
other
place
on
earth)
has
one
day
and
one
night.

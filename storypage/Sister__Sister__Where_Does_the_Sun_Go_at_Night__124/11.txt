I
know
you
are,
little
brother,
I
know
you
are,
And
maybe
you’re
right,
too...
But
in
the
books
that
I
have
read
That
is
not
what
they
said.
&nbsp;Then
what
did
they
say,
sister,
What
did
they
say?
Come
here,
little
brother,
I’ll
tell
you
what
they
said.
They
said,
they
said...
Tell
me,
sister,
what
did
they
say?

Where
does
the
sun
go
at
night?
The
earth
is
a
sphere
that
revolves
around
the
sun,
along
with
the
seven
other
planets
of
the
solar
system.
One
revolution
of
the
earth
around
the
sun
takes
one
calendar
year.


While
it
is
going
around
the
sun,
the
earth
also
spins
on
its
own
axis.
Each
‘spin’
takes
24
hours,
that
is,
a
day
and
a
night.
Whichever
part
of
the
earth
is
facing
the
sun
has
day.
At
the
same
time,
the
other
half
of
the
earth
(the
part
turned
away
from
the
sun)
has
night.
Then
the
earth
slowly
spins
around
and
the
half
that
was
in
darkness
(that
is,
the
half
that
was
turned
away
from
the
sun)
now
faces
the
sun.&nbsp;So
this
half
has
day,
and
the
other
half,
which
turned
away
from
the
sun
has
night.
So,
in
reality,
the
sun
does
not
really
go
anywhere
at
night!

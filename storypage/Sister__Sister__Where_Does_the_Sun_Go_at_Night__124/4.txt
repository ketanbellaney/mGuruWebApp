Oh
yes
you
are,
little
brother,
oh
yes
you
are
And
maybe
you
are
right,
too...
But
in
the
books
that
I
have
read
That
is
not
what
they
said.
&nbsp;Then
what
did
they
say,
sister,
What
did
they
say?
What
do
you
think,
little
brother,
What
do
you
think?
I
think,
I
think...
Tell
me,
little
brother,
what
do
you
think?

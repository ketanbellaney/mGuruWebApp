One
day,
all
the
animals
came
together.
“Did
you
hear?”
asked
Tota,
the
parrot.
“Yes,”
said
Hirni,
the
deer.
“What?”
asked
Darpok,
the
rabbit.
“We
have
a
school
in
the
jungle,”
answered
Zhoola,
the
monkey.
Mota,
the
elephant
wondered,
“Hmph?”
Lamboo,
the
giraffe
said,
“Oh,
good!”
Dheema,
the
snail
squealed,
“Hurry,
let’s
go!”

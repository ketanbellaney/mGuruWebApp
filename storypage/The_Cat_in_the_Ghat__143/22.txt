Sure
he’d
find
his
cat
somewhere
around
here,
Uncle
Sandy
decided
to
put
camera
traps
all
over.
Then
he
slept
a
good
night’s
sleep
Under
an
open
twinkling
sky,
on
a
hillock
steep.
&nbsp;
When
he
woke
up,
he
ran
to
his
camera
traps
and
checked.
Yes,
yes,
yes,
there
were
images
of
his
cat!!
The
cat
in
the
ghat!

“Are
you
talking
about
Pogeyan?”
he
said.
Uncle
Sandy
wasn’t
sure
what
he
meant.
“The
cat
that
comes
and
goes
as
the
mist,
Are
you
referring
to
that
elusive
cat
that
exists?”
“Yes
Sir,
that’s
the
one,”
Uncle
Sandy
affirmed.
He
was
so
happy
he
could’ve
drummed


and
hummed.
“Aha!”
said
the
tribesman,
pointing
to
the
mountains
higher
up,“I’ve
seen
the
cat
over
there,
all
of
three
times
in
close-up.”

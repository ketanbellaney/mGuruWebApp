The
cat
looked
the
same
as
it
did
ten
years
ago,
Uncle
Sandy
was
happy,
ho,
ho,
ho!
That’s
when
he
felt


a
tiny
snake
crawling
over
his
feet.
He
was
startled,
and
realised
he’d
been
dreaming
in
his
sleep.
&nbsp;
Uncle
Sandy
prayed
his
dream
would
come
true
Hope
he
finds
his
grey
cat
soon,
don’t
you?

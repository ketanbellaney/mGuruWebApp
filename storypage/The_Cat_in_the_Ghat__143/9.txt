What
Uncle
Sandy
saw
next
filled
him
with
glee,
A
family
of
elephants
bathing
in
a
pond,
yippee!
&nbsp;
They
were
making
the
most


of
the
pre-monsoon
showers,
Some
were
kicking
grass,


others
showing
off
their
powers.
&nbsp;
“Excuse
me
you
all,”
said
Uncle
Sandy,
waving
his
hat,“Would
you
have
seen
a
big
grey
cat?”

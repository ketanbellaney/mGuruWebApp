The
Cat
in
the
Ghat
is
a
whimsical
tale
of
Uncle
Sandy
going
in
search
of
a
mysterious
cat
in
the
Western
Ghats.
It
has
been
inspired
by
the
real-life
expedition
by
Sandesh
Kadur,
a
National
Geographic
Emerging
Explorer,
wildlife
filmmaker
and
conservation
photographer.
&nbsp;
His
goal
is
to
inspire
people
to
protect
and
appreciate
what
remains
of
our
wilderness.
He
is
still
looking
for
the
Pogeyan!

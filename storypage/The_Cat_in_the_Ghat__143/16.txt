As
he
went
further
into
the
forests
so
thick,
He
saw
that
the
trees
were
getting
fewer


very
quick.
“People
cut
trees,”
he
said,
“to
make
products
very
cheap,
And
the
poor
animals,
they
have
no
place
to
sleep.”
“These
jungles
are
their
homes
you
see,
just
like
our
houses
back
in
the
city.”
Sad
and
disheartened
by
the
state
of
affairs,
Uncle
Sandy
decided
to
say
a
silent
prayer.

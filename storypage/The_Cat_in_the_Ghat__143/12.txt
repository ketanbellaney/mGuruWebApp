“Walk
straight
through
the
tall
green
trees
Till
you
find
one
with
a
giant
hive
of
bees.”
“Under
that
tree
lives
a
frog
so
rare
It
lives
underground,
hiding
from
the


sun’s
glare.”
&nbsp;
“He’s
a
clever
frog
I’m
told,
Knows
the
whole
jungle
inside
out
and
two-fold.”
Uncle
Sandy
was
so
eager
to
look
for
the
froggy
He
left
without
saying
thank
you
to
the
monkey.

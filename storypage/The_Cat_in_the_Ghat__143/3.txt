Uncle
Sandy
didn't
want
to
work
in
big
offices,
He
wanted
to
take
pictures
of
snakes,


crocodiles
and
tortoises.
So
he
decided
to
leave


his
family
and
friends
behind,
And
took
off
to
the
jungles
with
freedom
in
mind.
On
his
first
expedition
to
the
Western
Ghats,
He
had
his
first
encounter
with
a
mysterious
cat.
Uncle
Sandy
has
been
on
its
trail
ever
since,
Hoping
to
click
a
picture
of
it,
for
evidence.

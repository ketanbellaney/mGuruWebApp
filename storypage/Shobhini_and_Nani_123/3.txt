Shobhini&nbsp;
Combs&nbsp;
Nani’s
Hair
&nbsp;
Nani
had
just
washed
her
hair.
Her
hair
was
long,
soft
and
white
and
it
was
shining
in
the
sunshine.
“Nani,
can
I
comb
your
hair
for
you?”
asked
Shobhini.
“I
will
do
it
carefully.
I
won’t
hurt
you
at
all.”
&nbsp;
Shobhini
combed
Nani’s
hair
carefully.
She
made
a
parting
in
the
middle
and
divided
her
hair
into
two
parts.
With
each
portion
she
made
a
pony
tail
on
either
side
of
Nani’s
head.
Not
happy
with
the
pony
tails,
she
made
them
into
two
long
plaits.
&nbsp;
Quickly
Shobhini
found
a
big
yellow
flower.
She
stuck
the
flower
in
one
of
Nani’s
plaits.
A
red
and
orange
butterfly
came
and
sat
down
on
Nani’s
hair.
Right
next
to
the
big
yellow
flower.
Shobhini
ran
to
bring
a
mirror.
&nbsp;
She
showed
Nani
the
two
long
plaits,
the
big
yellow
flower
and
the
colourful
butterfly.

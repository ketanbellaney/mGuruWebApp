Mela
&nbsp;
Shobhini
asked
Nani,
“Shall
we
go
to
the
mela?”
&nbsp;
From
a
distance
they
could
see
the
big
giant
wheel.
It
turned
slowly
and
then
faster
and
faster.
“Shall
we
take
a
ride
on
the
giant
wheel?”
Shobhini
said
to
Nani.
&nbsp;
The
wheel
began
to
move
slowly.
Then
it
began
to
go
faster
and
faster.
Shobhini
closed
her
eyes
tightly.
She
was
not
really
scared
but
felt
better
when
she
held
on
to
Nani’s
hand.
She
would
open
her
eyes
a
little
from
time
to
time
to
see
where
they
were.
Shobhini
noticed
that
Nani
did
not
shut
her
eyes.
Instead
she
was
laughing
and
waving
to
the
people
below.
&nbsp;
When
the
ride
was
over,
Shobhini
and
Nani
wandered
around
in
the
mela.
Shobhini
bought
a
little
horn.
She
tooted
so
hard
that
a
dog
jumped
up
and
ran
away.

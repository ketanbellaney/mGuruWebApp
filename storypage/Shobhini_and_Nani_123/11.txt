The&nbsp;
River
&nbsp;
It
was
a
hot
summer
day.
“Nani,
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
river
to
bathe?”
asked
Shobhini.
&nbsp;
The
river
was
quite
far
from
the
house.
Nani
and
Shobhini
sat
in
a
tonga
and
reached
the
riverbank.
Many
people
were
bathing
on
the
ghats.
The
water
near
the
banks
did
not
flow
very
fast.
Shobhini
had
brought
many
paper
boats
with
her.
One
of
her
boats
quickly
floated
away
very
far.
Nani
talked
to
a
boatman.
Shobhini
and
Nani
sat
in
the
boat
and
went
quite
far.
&nbsp;
The
boatman
said,
“The
water
is
very
deep
here.
If
you
put
one
elephant
on
top
of
another,
they
would
both
sink.”
&nbsp;
‘Wow!
One
elephant
on
top
of
another,’
thought
Shobhini,
entranced.
A
goldfish
leapt
out
of
the
water.
It
touched
Shobhini’s
hand.
Shobhini
was
delighted.

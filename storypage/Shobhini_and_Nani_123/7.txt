Rain
&nbsp;
It
was
raining.
Sometimes
it
was
windy
and
the
rain
came
pouring
down
hard
and
loud.
Sometimes
the
rain
was
soft.
&nbsp;
Shobhini
asked
Nani,
“Can
I
go
out
and
play
in
the
rain?
I
want
to
get
wet.”
&nbsp;
“Be
careful
of
the
lightning,”
replied
Nani.
Shobhini’s
dog
Pillu
was
under
the
chair.
When
he
saw
Shobhini
with
an
umbrella,
he
came
out
from
under
the
chair.
Pillu
licked
Shobhini’s
hand
and
wagged
his
tail.
&nbsp;
“All
right,”
said
Shobhini
“You
can
come
too.”
&nbsp;
Shobhini
walked
ahead.
Pillu
was
just
behind
her.
As
they
reached
the
end
of
the
verandah,
there
was
a
sudden
gust
of
wind.
Shobhini’s
umbrella
flew
out
of
her
hand
and
out
onto
the
grass.
There
was
a
streak
of
lightning
in
the
sky.
Shobhini
stopped.

Wool
&nbsp;
Nani
was
sitting
in
the
sun.
She
was
rolling
wool
into
a
ball.
“Can
I
help
you?”
asked
Shobhini.
&nbsp;
Shobhini
looked
for
the
end
of
the
wool.
She
started
rolling
it
into
a
ball
like
Nani
was
doing.
Soon
the
wool
became
a
big
ball.
When
it
was
too
big,
it
slipped
out
of
Shobhini’s
hand
and
jumped
up
in
the
air.
&nbsp;
Many
swans
were
flying
overhead.
One
of
them
caught
the
ball
of
wool.
Shobhini
looked
up
and
saw
a
long
string
of
red
wool
hanging
from
the
sky.
Shobhini
clapped
her
hands
when
she
saw
this
sight.
The
other
end
of
the
wool
slipped
out
of
her
hands.


When
the
swan
heard
the
clap
he
looked
down.
He
could
see
Shobhini
on
the
ground
but
she
looked
very
small
from
so
high
up.

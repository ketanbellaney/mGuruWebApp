Jungle
&nbsp;
“Shall
we
go
to
the
jungle?”
Shobhini
asked
Nani.
“There
are
wild
animals
there.
You
won’t
be
scared,
I
hope?”
&nbsp;
Shobhini
and
Nani
reached
the
jungle.
First
they
saw
a
rabbit.
He
was
lost
and
was
looking
for
his
mother.
His
eyes
were
full
of
tears.
Shobhini
and
Nani
helped
him
find
his
mother.
&nbsp;
Elephants
were
bathing
in
the
river.
They
filled
water
in
their
trunks
and
sprayed
it
like
a
fountain
over
each
other.
It
looked
like
a
lot
of
fun.
&nbsp;
One
monkey
was
eating
a
mango
on
a
tree.
Shobhini
teased
the
monkey
and
made
a
face
at
him.
The
monkey
was
furious.
He
took
a
mango
and
threw
it
at
Shobhini.
Nani
quickly
put
her
hand
out
and
swiftly
caught
the
mango
before
it
could
hit
Shobhini.
It
was
a
very
good
catch.
“Wow
!
Nani
!!”
said
Shobhini.
“I
did
not
know
that
you
could
play
cricket!”

Tara
could
not
sit
still!
The
train
seemed
to
be
going
very
slowly.
Tara
peered
out
through
the
window.
Lights
winked
from
windows
in
tall
buildings.


As
everyone
in
the
bogey
prepared
to
sleep,
one
passenger
asked
Tara,
“Beti,
I
hope
you
are
not
running
away
from
home?”
“No,
no!”
said
Tara.
Early
in
the
morning,Tara
got
off
the
train
at
Meenapur.

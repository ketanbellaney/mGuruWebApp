Tara
made
a
small
bonfire.
She
ate
some
food
that
she
had
packed
and
settled
down
under
the
sky.
Stars
twinkled
like
friends.
Tomorrow
she
would
cross
the
forest
by
foot,
and
then
take
a
bus
to
the
village
where
her
great
grandparents
lived.


For
today,
Tara
Prakash,
famous
wildlife
photographer,
was
just
going
to
sleep
under
the
stars
and
dream
about
home.

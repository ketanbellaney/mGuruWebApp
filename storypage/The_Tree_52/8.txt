Here
is
a
tree.
The
tree
is
on
the
ground.
Its
roots
are
in
the
soil.
Soil
covers
the
roots.
The
trunk
stands
above.
Branches
spread
from
the
trunk.
Leaves
sprout
from
the
branches.
Flowers
bloom
by
the
leaves.
And
fruits
grow
from
flowers,
and
green
grass
grows
all
around.
And
green
grass
grows
all
around.

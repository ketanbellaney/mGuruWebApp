I
know
you
are,
little
brother,&nbsp;
I
know
you
areAnd
maybe
you’re
right,
too…
But
in
all
the
books
that
I
have
read
That
is
not
what
they
said.
Then
what
did
they
say,
sister,
What
did
they
say?
What
do
you
think,
little
brother,
What
do
you
think?
I
think,
I
think…
Tell
me,
little
brother,&nbsp;
What
do
you
think?

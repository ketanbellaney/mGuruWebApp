Where
does
thunder
come
from?
&nbsp;Everything
around
us
is
made
up
of
tiny
particles
called
atoms.
Each
atom
has
a
nucleus
at
the
centre,
which
is
filled
with
particles
called
neutrons
and
positively
charged
particles
called
protons.
Even
tinier
particles
(negatively
charged)
called
electrons
go
around
the
nucleus
like
the
planets
go
around
the
sun.
&nbsp;
In
a
thundercloud,
air
carries
bits
of
ice
and
water
droplets
upwards.
When
they
rub
against
each
other,
the
atoms
in
them
become
ions
(that
is,
they
become
charged
positively
or
negatively).
The
positive
ions
are
lighter
and
move
upwards,
while
the
heavier
negative
ions
move
downwards
to
the
bottom
of
the
cloud.

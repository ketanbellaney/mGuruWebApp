I
think
the
old
woman
opens
her
trunk
Pulls
out
a
game
of
chaupad
And
a
pair
of
giant
dice.
The
children
clap
their
hands
in
excitement
Roll
the
giant
dice
And
forget
they
were
ever
bored.
I
think
that’s
where
the
thunder
comes
from
From
the
dance
of
a
pair
of
dice
As
they
make
their
way
across
the
skies.
I’m
clever,
aren’t
I,
sister?

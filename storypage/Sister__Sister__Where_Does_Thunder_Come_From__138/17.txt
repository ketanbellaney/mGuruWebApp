The
negative
ions
at
the
bottom
of
the
cloud
attract
the
positive
ions
on
the
earth.
When
they
start
flowing
towards
each
other,
electricity
is
created,
which
becomes
a
huge,
powerful
flash
of
lightning.

&nbsp;
The
lightning
makes
the
air
around
it
very,
very
hot
almost
as
hot
as
the
sun!
This
hot
air
expands
very
quickly,
causing
a
big
explosion.
It
then
begins
to
contract
equally
quickly
once
the
lightning
flash
has
passed.
This
explosion
of
air
is
what
causes
the
sound
waves
that
we
call
thunder.

Try&nbsp;
this&nbsp;
experiment!
&nbsp;
To
understand
how
particles
with
opposite
charges
attract
each
other,
let’s
make
a
magic
‘magnetic
balloon’!
&nbsp;
You&nbsp;
need:
A
balloon
A
piece
of
wool
or
silk
A
wall
&nbsp;
What&nbsp;
to&nbsp;
do:
1.	Blow
up
the
balloon.
2.	Rub
it
briskly
with
the
piece
of
wool
or
silk.
3.	Hold
it
against
the
wall
and
watch
it
‘stick’
there
like
a
magnet
to
iron!
&nbsp;
Why&nbsp;
does&nbsp;
this&nbsp;
happen?
When
you
rub
the
balloon
with
the
wool
or
silk,
electrons
get
transferred
between
the
two.
The
atoms
in
the
balloon
take
in
more
electrons,
so
the
balloon
becomes
negatively
charged.
When
you
hold
it
against
the
wall,
the
negative
ions
in
the
balloon
get
attracted
to
the
positive
ions
in
the
wall,
causing
the
balloon
to
stick
to
the
wall!

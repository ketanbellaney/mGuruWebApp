“How
much
of
this
powder
will
we
need,
Father?”
asked
Theingi
excitedly.
“A
kilo,”
replied
Thet.
“A
kilo!”
cried
Theingi.
“That
would
require
hundreds
of
banana
plants!”
 
“I’m
afraid
so,
Son,”
said
the
old
man.
“That
is
why
I
can’t
complete
the
task
myself…”
“Don’t
lose
heart,
Father!”
said
Theingi.
“I
shall!”
Later
that
evening,
the
old
man
taught
his
son-in-law
the
magic
spells
and
loaned
him
the
money
to
start
the
work.
 
The
very
next
day,
Theingi
bought
a
small
field
near
his
home
and
cleared
it.
Just
as
he
had
been
instructed,
he
dug
the
ground
himself
and
planted
the
saplings
after
carefully
chanting
the
magic
spells.
Every
day
he
went
to
the
field
and
examined
the
saplings.
He
kept
the
weeds
and
pests
away
diligently.
When
the
plants
grew
and
bore
fruit,
he
carefully
collected
the
silver
powder
from
the
leaves
and
kept
it
safely
in
a
box.

Once
upon
a
time,
in
a
little
village
on
the
banks
of
the
Irrawaddy
river,
there
lived
a
young
woman
called
Thuza.
She
was
very
happily
married
to
handsome
young
Theingi.
But
there
was
one
problem
that
nagged
Thuza
–
her
husband
believed
he
was
an
alchemist
and
would
spend
all
his
time
dreaming
about
ways
to
turn
dirt
into
gold.
 
All
day,
and
for
days
on
end,
Theingi
spent
his
time
in
experiments,
searching
for
a
breakthrough.
Soon,
all
their
money
was
over,
and
young
Thuza
had
to
struggle
to
buy
food
for
the
two
of
them.
She
became
very
worried.
“You
should
find
a
job
soon,”
she
pleaded
with
her
husband.
“We
cannot
continue
like
this!”
 
But
Theingi
wouldn’t
listen.
“I’m
on
the
verge
of
a
breakthrough!
Why
do
I
have
to
work
when
we
will
be
rich
beyond
our
wildest
dreams?
We
will
soon
be
able
to
turn
all
the
dirt
we
find
into
gold!”
 
Disheartened,
Thuza
approached
her
father,
wise
old
Thet,
for
a
solution.
Thet
was
surprised
when
he
heard
that
his
son-in-law
was
an
alchemist.
He
thought
for
a
while
and
asked
to
see
Theingi.
Thuza
returned
home
happily
that
day,
for
she
knew
her
wise
father
would
have
a
solution.

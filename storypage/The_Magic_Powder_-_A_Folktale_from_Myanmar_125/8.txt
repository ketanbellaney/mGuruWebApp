“Then
you
must
have
been
able
to
save
some
money
too.
Theingi
grew
more
than
enough
bananas…”
the
old
man
continued.
“Yes,
I
did,”
replied
Thuza.
“Can
we
see
it?”
asked
Thet.
“Of
course,
I
have
kept
it
safely
at
home,”
beamed
Thuza.




The
three
of
them
went
to
Theingi’s
house
where
Thuza
produced
several
bags
from
the
loft
where
she
had
kept
them
safely.
Thet
opened
one
of
the
bags,
peered
inside,
and
smiled.
He
then
emptied
one
of
the
bags
on
the
table.
Gold
coins
tinkled
as
they
fell
in
a
huge,
shiny
heap.
Then
he
went
to
the
field
and
came
back
with
a
handful
of
dirt,
which
he
placed
next
to
the
heap
of
gold.
“You
see,
Theingi,”
he
said,
turning
to
his
son-in-law,
“you
have
changed
dirt
into
gold!”
 
Never
after
that
day
did
Theingi
collect
any
more
magic
powder
from
the
leaves.
But
he
continued
to
grow
bananas.
His
“alchemist”
father-in-law
had
taught
him
the
best
way
to
turn
dirt
into
gold,
after
all.
He
didn’t
need
the
magic
powder
any
more.

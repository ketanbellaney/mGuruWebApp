There
was
hardly
any
powder
on
each
leaf,
so
Theingi
had
to
buy
more
land
and
grow
more
bananas.
But
he
was
determined
to
do
what
was
needed.
It
took
him
several
years,
but
at
the
end
of
it
all,
he
had
managed
to
collect
enough
of
the
magic
powder.
He
rushed
to
his
father-in-law,
excited
as
never
before.
He
would
soon
be
able
to
make
gold
from
mere
dirt!
 
“Father,
finally…
here
is
the
kilo
of
magic
powder!”
he
cried.
 
The
old
man
was
filled
with
joy.
“Wonderful!’’
he
said.
“Wonderful!
You’ve
done
well,
Theingi.
I’m
proud
of
you.
Now
I
will
show
you
how
to
turn
dirt
into
gold.
But
first,
let’s
get
Thuza.
We
need
her
help.”
Theingi
was
a
little
puzzled,
but
without
losing
any
time,
he
ran
to
his
wife
and
was
soon
back
with
her.
 
“Thuza,”
asked
the
old
man,
“what
did
you
do
with
the
bananas
when
your
husband
was
collecting
the
powder?”
“Why,
I
sold
them,
Father,”
replied
Thuza.
“That’s
how
we
earned
a
living.”

Remove
the
toothpick
and
repeat
the
above
step
at
another
spot
on
the
banana,
say
after
an
inch.
Keep
making
internal
one-inch
slices
until
you
have
at
least
five
or
six.
Do
these
two
steps
with
all
the
bananas
you
have.
That’s
it
–
your
magic
bananas
are
ready
to
eat.
Offer
the
“new
variety”
to
your
friends
while
telling
them
a
big
story
about
how
you
discovered
them
in
the
field
nearby.
When
your
friends
peel
the
banana,
imagine
the
look
on
their
faces
when
they
find
that
it
is
already
sliced?
While
inside
the
skin!
Isn’t
that
some
yummy
banana
magic?

The
next
day,
Theingi
arrived
at
his
father-in-law’s
house,
fully
prepared
for
a
scolding.
He
was
taken
by
surprise
when
Thet
took
him
aside
and
whispered,
“When
I
was
young
like
you,
I
was
an
alchemist
too!”
 
The
two
of
them
spent
the
whole
afternoon
discussing
Theingi’s
work.
Finally,
the
old
man
stood
up
and
said,
“Why
Theingi,
you’ve
done
everything
exactly
like
I
did
when
I
was
your
age!
You
are
definitely
on
the
verge
of
a
breakthrough!
Congratulations!
But
you
seem
to
be
lacking
one
very
important
ingredient
in
your
experiments.
You
will
need
this
when
you
finally
turn
dirt
to
gold.
Only
recently
did
I
discover
this.
But
I
am
too
old
for
this
task.
It
requires
enormous
effort…”
 
“Then
let
me
do
it
for
you,
Father!”
cried
Theingi.
He
was
really
excited.
All
his
efforts
would
pay
off
at
last.
“Tell
me
what
the
ingredient
is!”
 
“Good,
you
are
excited!”
said
Thet.
He
leaned
closer
and
whispered,
“Son,
the
secret
ingredient
is
a
silver
powder
that
is
found
only
on
banana
leaves.
You
will
have
to
plant
the
bananas
yourself
and
cast
certain
spells
on
them.
Then,
as
the
plants
grow,
the
powder
on
the
leaves
will
gain
magical
powers.”

HOW&nbsp;
TO&nbsp;
MAKE&nbsp;
IT:
1.
Push
the
toothpick
into
the
banana
somewhere
along
the
seam.
&nbsp;
2.
Without
taking
it
out,
carefully
rotate
the
toothpick
left
and
right
inside
the
banana.
You
should
cut
all
the
way
through
the
fruit,
but
not
through
the
peel,
mind
you.
Also,
try
and
keep
the
toothpick
hole
as
small
as
possible
â€“
the
smaller,
the
lesser
it
will
be
visible.

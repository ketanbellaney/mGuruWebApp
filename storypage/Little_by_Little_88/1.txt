Tullu
and
Bullu
were
twin
rabbits
who
lived
in
a
jungle.
The
jungle
was
full
of
wild
animals.
But
Tullu
and
Bullu
had
built
a
sturdy
house
for
themselves
and
they
lived
in
it
safely
and
happily.
&nbsp;
One
cold
winter
evening,
the
twins
were
warming
themselves
by
a
fire
they
had
lit,
when
someone
knocked
at
their
door.
&nbsp;
It&nbsp;
was&nbsp;
a&nbsp;
big&nbsp;
wolf!

The
twins
looked
at
the
pan
of
water
on
the
fire.
The
water
was
getting
hot.
They
opened
the
door
a
little
wider.
Now
just
the
wolf’s
nose
was
outside
the
door.
&nbsp;
After
ten
minutes
the
wolf
said,
“I
feel
so
nice
and
warm!
Only
my
nose
is
still
cold.
Kind
rabbits,
please
open
your
door
a
little
more.
Don’t
be
scared
of
me.
I’m
harmless.”

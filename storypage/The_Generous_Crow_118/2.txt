For
a
while,
Kaage
enjoyed
the
song.
Then
she
got
mad.
It
just
wasn't
fair!
It
was
she
who
had
warmed
the
egg
that
the
koel
had
hatched
from,
and
now
that
little
bird
was
singing
so
much
better
than
her!
But
she
should
not
be
jealous,
she
told
herself.
The
thing
to
do
was
to
take
singing
lessons
from
the
koel.

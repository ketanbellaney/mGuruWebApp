The
koel
was
waiting
impatiently.
As
soon
as
Kaage
landed
on
a
nearby
branch,
the
music
lesson
began.
&nbsp;
“Now,
let
me
hear
you
sing
this,”
said
the
koel.
“Kuhoo,
kuhoo…”
&nbsp;
Eagerly,
Kaage
tried.
But
all
she
could
say
was
“Kaa,
kaa.”
&nbsp;
After
a
while,
the
koel
had
had
enough.
“You
are
impossible,”
she
declared.
“You
will
have
to
find
yourself
another
teacher.”
And
off
she
flew.

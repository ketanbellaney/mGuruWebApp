Kaage
went
looking
for
the
koel,
and
found
her
at
last.
The
koel
looked
at
her
a
little
suspiciously,
but
Kaage
was
very
respectful.
&nbsp;
“Will
you
teach
me
to
sing?”
Kaage
asked
humbly.
&nbsp;
“All
right,”
said
the
koel.
“But
on
one
condition.
You
have
to
be
here
very
early
each
morning,
at
daybreak.”




Kaage
nodded.
&nbsp;
“Good.
Class
begins
tomorrow,”
said
the
koel,
flying
off
on
her
errands.

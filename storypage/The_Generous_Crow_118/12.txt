It
was
then
that
a
thought
struck
Kaage.
All
right,
so
she
couldn't
sing
or
dance
or
build
a
beautiful
nest.
But
which
other
bird,
when
it
found
food,
invited
others
to
share
it?
Not
the
koel,
not
the
peacock,
and
certainly
not
the
sparrow.
No
bird,
in
fact,
except
other
crows
like
her.
Kaage
was
thrilled
that
she
had
discovered
this
for
herself.

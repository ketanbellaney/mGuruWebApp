Days
passed.
One
day,
Kaage
watched
as
the
sky
filled
with
dark
clouds.
A
cool
breeze
began
to
blow
and
it
began
to
drizzle
a
little.
From
her
nest,
Kaage
could
see
the
peacock
spread
his
beautiful
tail
feathers
and
begin
to
dance.
She
was
filled
with
the
urge
to
dance.
'Maybe
the
peacock
can
help,'&nbsp;
she
thought
to
herself,
and
flew
off
to
look
for
him.

“Good.
Remember,
if
I
hear
you
are
even
passing
through
these
parts,
I’ll
make
a
paste
of
you
and
your
gang
and
feed
it
to
the
fish
in
this
river.”


“Yes,
Maharaj.
But
please,
do
tell
me,
who
are
you?
I
have
never
seen
you
in
these
parts.”

“I
am
a
guardian
of
this
village,”
Paplu
said.
He
paused
for
a
good
ten
seconds
and
then
in
his
deepest
tone
said,
“And
my
name
is
Paplu,
the
Giant.”
&nbsp;
And
with
these
words,
Paplu
stormed
back
to
the
village.
Angaar
and
his
men
left
the
same
night
and
were
never
heard
of
again.
&nbsp;
Paplu
went
back
to
his
original
shape
and
size.
However,
he
couldn’t
get
back
his
original
name.
No
one
called
him
Paplu
anymore.
To
everyone,
and
even
to
Soni,
he
was
Paplu,
the
Giant.

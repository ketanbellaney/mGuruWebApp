Raghav
went
back
home
and
summoned
all
the
tailors
in
the
village.
Twenty
one
tailors
appeared
in
no
time.
Raghav
explained
the
problem
to
them
and
said,
“I
want
a
pair
of
pyjamas
and
a
kurta,
to
be
stitched
as
soon
as
possible
for
Paplu.”
&nbsp;
Soon
‘Operation
Paplu
Dress’
started.
It
was
quite
funny
to
see
the
tailors
scrambling
up
Paplu’s
back,
legs
and
hands
to
take
his
measurements.
The
whole
village
got
into
action
contributing
whatever
material
they
could.
Even
Soni
donated
her
doll’s
shawl
to
the
project!
&nbsp;
In
seven
hours,
the
dress
was
ready.
In
seven
hours,
with
a
whoop
of
joy,
Paplu
stood
up
towering
over
the
villagers.
He
looked
really
smart
with
the
multi-coloured
kurta
and
an
equally
multi-coloured
pyjama.
There
was
thunderous
applause.

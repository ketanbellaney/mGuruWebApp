Trees
had
started
swaying
and
the
noise
was
slowly
becoming
deafening.


“WHOOSH!
WHOOSH!”
Angaar
felt
himself
being
picked
up
by
the
air
current.
He
desperately
tried
to
hold
on,
flaying
his
arms
and
legs,
but
it
was
no
use.
He
was
flying
in
the
air.
&nbsp;
To
his
left,
was
his
deputy
Jarnail
looking
like
an
ungainly
dinosaur.
To
his
right,
was
his
most
accomplished
swordsman,
Talwar,
air-borne
like
his
colleagues,
desperately
trying
to
reach
out
for
his
sword
which
was
flying
ahead
of
him.
A
few
minutes
later,
there
was
a
splash.

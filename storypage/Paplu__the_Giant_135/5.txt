Then
Paplu
heard
a
soft
lisp.
“Paplu
paiyaa,
play
with
me,
pleath.”
&nbsp;
It
was
his
two-year
old
neighbour
Soni.
Paplu
was
her
best
friend.
He
picked
her
up
and
threw
her
high
in
the
air
and
she
started
singing:
“Paplu
paiyya,
Paplu
paiyaa
thlow
me
up,
cath
me
quick,
Paplu
paiyya,
Paplu
paiyya
please
show
me
youll
magic
thlik.”
&nbsp;
Paplu
froze!
These
words
and
the
tune
sounded
very
familiar.
He
rushed
inside
and
came
out
with
a
blue
stone
in
his
hand.
&nbsp;
He
now
remembered
what
his
mother
had
told
him,
“Son,
throw
the
stone
in
the
air
and
say
these
words:
I’ll
throw
you
up,
I’ll
catch
you
quick.
Don’t
forget
my
magic
trick.”

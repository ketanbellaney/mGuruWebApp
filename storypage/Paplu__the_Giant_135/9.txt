What
was
he
to
do
now?
Although
he
had
become
a
giant,
he
couldn’t
venture
out
on
his
rescue
mission
in
his
birthday
suit.
He
needed
clothes
urgently.
But
how
was
he
to
get
clothes
his
size
and
that
too,
quickly?
&nbsp;
He
heard
a
voice
and
looked
down.
It
was
Raghav.
“Soni
told
me
you
had
become
big
and
that
you
had
run
away
somewhere.
When
I
heard
this
strange
story,
I
came
out
to
investigate.”
&nbsp;
“Using
a
magic
trick
my
mother
taught
me,
I
have
become
a
giant.
Now
I
can
take
care
of
Angaar
and
his
gang,”
said
Paplu.
&nbsp;
“That’s
great,
then
what
are
you
waiting
for?”
“My
clothes
didn’t
keep
pace
with
my
growth.
I
am
wearing
almost
nothing.
How
can
I
come
out
like
this?”
Raghav
thought
for
some
time
and
said,
“Okay,
give
me
some
time.
By
nightfall,
I’ll
have
your
clothes
ready.”

It
was
just
past
midnight.
Angaar
and
his
men
were
fast
asleep.
Only
two
bandits
were
on
guard.
Suddenly
Angaar
woke
up.
He
could
hear
a
strange
sound.
He
got
up
and
picking
up
his
sword,
rushed
out
of
his
tent.
The
other
dacoits
too
were
coming
out
of
their
enclosures,
spears
and
swords
in
hand.
&nbsp;
“Whoosh!”
There
was
the
sound
again.
It
seemed
to
be
growing
louder
and
closer.
“WHOOSH!”
&nbsp;
Angaar
looked
around.
A
dust
storm
seemed
to
be
gathering
momentum.

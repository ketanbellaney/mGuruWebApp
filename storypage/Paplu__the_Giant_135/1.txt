This
is
the
story
of
a
nine-year
old
giant
called
Paplu.
He
was
very
different
from
the
other
giants.
They
loved
to
fight,
whereas
Paplu
hated
fighting.
While
his
classmates
would
spend
their
time
twisting
the
ears
of
dinosaurs
or
yanking
the
tails
of
tigers,
Paplu
would
be
busy
protecting
his
friends.


Paplu’s
mother
was
worried
about
her
son.
One
night
she
woke
up
Paplu.
“Son,
you
will
never
be
happy
staying
in
our
tribe.
I
am
taking
you
to
a
village
where
people
are
normal
human
beings.
You
will
stay
there
with
Raghav,
the
head
man.”
&nbsp;
Just
before
they
reached
the
village,
Paplu’s
mother
asked
him
to
close
his
eyes.
When
he
opened
them,
he
almost
fainted.
He
had
shrunk
to
one-tenth
his
size
and
so
had
she.
Paplu’s
mother
handed
him
over
to
Raghav
and
left.

Paplu
soon
made
friends
with
the
boys
and
girls
of
the
village.
&nbsp;
One
day
Raghav
came
home
very
worried.


“A
ruthless
bandit
called
Angaar
has
blocked
the
only
way
out
of
our
village.
We
cannot
go
to
our
farms
to
work
and
will
surely
starve,”
he
said.
Paplu
wished
he
could
help
Raghav
in
some
way.
&nbsp;
Paplu
suddenly
remembered
something.
Before
leaving
the
forest,
his
mother
had
told
him
the
magic
words
which
would
make
him
a
giant
once
again.
And
as
a
giant,
he
would
easily
be
able
to
take
care
of
Angaar.
&nbsp;
Paplu
did
everything
he
could,
including
standing
on
his
head
and
pulling
his
own
ears,
but
he
couldn’t
remember
those
words.

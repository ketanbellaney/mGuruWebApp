As
Paplu
threw
the
stone
and
recited
the
words,
he
felt
himself
swelling
up
like
a
balloon.
&nbsp;
Suddenly
he
heard
a
sound
–
R-r-rip!
R-ri-ip!!
His
clothes
were
tearing.
If
he
didn’t
look
for
cover,
he
would
soon
be
standing
bang
in
the
middle
of
the
village,
in
clothes
hundred
sizes
too
small
for
him.
&nbsp;
All
he
would
have
to
cover
his
modesty
would
be
strips
of
cloth
and
little
else.
Paplu
rushed
into
the
woods
with
the
sound
‘R-r-rip!
Rri-i-p!’
chasing
him.
Once
deep
into
the
undergrowth,
Paplu
got
down
on
his
knees.
&nbsp;
It
looked
like
he
had
missed
a
word
or
two
in
the
magic
chant
his
mother
had
made
him
learn.
That
is
why
his
clothes
had
not
grown
along
with
his
body!

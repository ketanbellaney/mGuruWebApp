They
landed
in
the
river
to
the
south
of
the
village.
As
they
swam
to
the
shore,
spluttering
and
shivering,
a
huge
shadow
loomed
over
their
heads.
&nbsp;
“Angaar,
you
scoundrel!”
the
shadow
thundered,
its
voice
echoing
in
the
night.
&nbsp;
“Y…yes,”
stammered
the
dreaded
Angaar.
He
had
never
been
so
terrified
in
his
life,
since
the
day
his
father,
Rosh
Bundela
had
walloped
him
for
eating
up
his
jalebis.
&nbsp;
“This
time
I
have
merely
roughed
you
up.
Next
time,
if
you
or
any
of
your
men
come
anywhere
close
to
the
village,
I’ll
rip
each
and
every
limb
from
your
bodies
and
chew
them
up.”
&nbsp;
“Y..yes,
Maharaj,
we
will
never
again
come
within
a
thousand
miles
of
this
place.”

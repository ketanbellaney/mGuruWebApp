“Our
father
is
a
sailor
and
he
sailed
for
Kamboja
many
months
ago.
We
want
to
ask
the
sailors
if
they
have
seen
his
ship.”
&nbsp;
“Kamboja?”
the
soldier
asked.
He
then
pointed
to
the
ship
with
the
black
and
green
sails
and
said,
“That
ship’s
arrived
from
there.”
&nbsp;
Basava
and
Sundari
ran
to
the
ship,
up
the
gangplank
and
on
to
its
deck.
They
stopped
when
they
saw
that
all
the
sailors
on
board
were
foreigners.
They
were
speaking
to
each
other
in
a
strange
tongue!
&nbsp;
“Oh
no!”
Basava
sighed.
“How
do
we
make
them
understand
us?”
&nbsp;
“Easy!”
Sundari
grinned.
“We
talk
to
them
like
Amma
does
when
they
come
to
buy
vegetables.”
“Of
course!”
laughed
Basava,
“We
act
and
make
signs
with
our
hands.”
&nbsp;
They
looked
around
trying
to
spot
a
sailor
with
a
friendly
face.
Finally,
they
went
up
to
a
sailor
sitting
on
a
roll
of
rope.

This
morning,
as
Basava
was
laying
out
bundles
of
spinach
and
cabbage,
one
of
their
regular
customers
came
to
buy
vegetables.
She
was
the
wife
of
a
trader
who
often
sent
spices
to
other
lands
by
ship.
She
knew
all
about
the
ships
coming
and
going
from
Mamallapuram.
&nbsp;
As
she
picked
through
the
radishes
and
beans,
the
trader’s
wife
asked,
“Any
news
of
your
father?”


Sundari
shook
her
head
sadly.
“Why
don’t
you
go
and
ask
at
the
jetty
where
all
the
ships
are
anchored?”
she
said.
“Ask
what?”
Basava
leaned
forward
eagerly.
“Ask
the
sailors
if
they
have
seen
your
father’s
ship
on
their
way
to
Mamallapuram.
My
husband
does
that
quite
often
when
his
ships
are
late.”
That
afternoon,the
children
headed
towards
the
main
jetty.
They
went
through
the
market
and
took
the
street
going
towards
the
sea.
They
went
past
the
warehouses
where
the
merchants
kept
the
goods
meant
to
be
loaded
into
ships.






In
one
warehouse,
labourers
were
unloading
bags
of
pepper
and
coriander
seeds.
In
another,
they
were
stacking
up
bales
of
cotton
cloth
woven
in
bright
colours.

“She
has
never
strayed
so
far
before,”
said
Kishen
puzzled.
Shagufta
started
chewing
her
dupatta,
as
she
always
did
when
she
got
worried.
&nbsp;
“Don’t
eat
your
clothes,”
said
Kishen,
“Look
here,
I
have
got
some
achar.
It
is
still
a
bit
raw
and
sour—it
hasn’t
matured
yet.
Don’t
tell
anyone.
Maaji
had
put
the
new
achar
out
in
the
sun
and
I
stole
two
pieces.”
&nbsp;
He
unfurled
a
small
packet
tied
up
in
leaves
and
held
it
out.
Shagufta
loved
the
tangy,
spicy
flavour
of
unripe
pickle.
She
chewed
her
piece
meditatively
and
said,
“You
know,
Kishen,
Abba
jaan
told
me
this
morning
that
we
have
become
'sutantar'
or
independent.”
&nbsp;
“What
does
that
mean?
Sutantar?”
“That
means
that
we
will
rule
ourselves
now,”
said
Shagufta,
trying
to
understand
herself
what
it
meant.

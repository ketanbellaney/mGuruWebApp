“Then
what
do
we
do?”
asked
the
king.
“If
the
animals
cannot
bear
the
noise
then
my
citizens
certainly
cannot.
And
we
cannot
have
a
country
full
of
sleepless
people.”
&nbsp;
Another
minister
stepped
forward
bravely.
“Sire,
I
would
be
willing
to
keep
the
bird.
I
have
a
newborn
baby
boy
and
his
crying
keeps
us
up
at
night
anyway.”
&nbsp;
“No,
no,
we
need
to
find
a
better
place,”
said
Chintamani.

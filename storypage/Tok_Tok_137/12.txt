That
night
he
bought
Pasupati
the
zoo-keeper
to
the
palace
after
everyone
had
gone
to
bed.
&nbsp;
Tok-tok
tok-tok!
&nbsp;
When
the
zoo-keeper
heard
the
sound
he
rushed
home
and
brought
back
a
cage
and
a
bowl
of
worms.
Pasupati
then
had
the
royal
carpenter
cut
a
hole
in
the
wall
nearest
the
sound.
He
put
the
bowl
of
worms
near
the
hole.
Everybody
stepped
back
and
waited
silently.

“What
is
this
commotion?”
the
king
asked
his
bodyguards
angrily.
&nbsp;
“No
idea,
sire,”
said
the
guards,
shaking
a
little
bit.
“We’ve
been
searching
for
the
person
making
the
noise.
But
we
have
not
found
anything.”
&nbsp;
“Idiots,”
the
king
grumbled
under
his
breath.
“If
you
don’t
find
out
what
it
is
in
the
next
five
minutes,
I’m
firing
all
of
you,”
he
shouted.
&nbsp;
Tok-tok…
tok-tok!

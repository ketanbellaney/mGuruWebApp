“Sir,
please
help
us
find
what
is
making
this
tok-tok
sound
or
we
will
all
lose
our
jobs,”
they
pleaded
with
him.
&nbsp;
“Fools!”
Ranveer
Singh
muttered.
He
collected
a
platoon
of
soldiers.
&nbsp;
Tok-tok…
tok-tok!
&nbsp;
“Ready,
men?
Go
find
this
intruder
right
now!”
he
ordered.
The
men
marched
all
around
the
palace
searching,
searching,
searching.

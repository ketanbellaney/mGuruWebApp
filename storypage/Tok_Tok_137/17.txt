And
that
is
how
the
tok-tok
bird
ended
far
away
from
the
palace
and
the
towns
of
Sonapur,
giving
company
to
the
border
patrol.

It
kept
the
soldiers
awake
every
night
and
did
its
job
so
well
that
it
became
the
official
bird
of
the
country.
The
kingdomâ€™s
enemies
could
never
get
by
the
alert
Sonapur
soldiers
and
grumbled
that
the
country
should
change
its
name
to
Jaagpur
instead.

A
small
red
and
brown
bird
with
a
long
yellow
beak
stepped
out
of
the
hole
and
jumped
into
the
bowl.
Swoosh!
The
bird
was
in
the
cage.
The
king
was
amazed.
&nbsp;
“Such
a
tiny
bird
and
such
a
loud
noise!
Thank
you
everyone.
You
have
done
a
great
service
to
the
country.”
&nbsp;
The
next
morning
the
king
reached
the
durbar
bright
and
early.
Pasupati
the
zoo-keeper
was
standing
in
front
of
him.
&nbsp;
“Sire,
I
cannot
keep
the
bird.”

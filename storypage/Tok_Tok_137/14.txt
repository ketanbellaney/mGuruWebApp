“What
happened?”
asked
the
king.
“The
tok-tok
noise
kept
all
the
animals
in
the
zoo
awake.
They
are
all
sleeping
now
and
the
children
visiting
the
zoo
are
very
disappointed.”
&nbsp;
“Hmmm,”
said
the
king.
He
wondered
if
the
bird
would
make
a
good
cutlet.
&nbsp;
“No
sir,
we
cannot
kill
the
bird,”
said
Chintamani
firmly.
He
was
good
at
guessing
the
king’s
thoughts.
&nbsp;
“It
is
very
rare
and
must
be
considered
a
lucky
bird.”

“And
last
night’s
butter
chicken
is
still
squawking
in
my
stomach.
Just
cut
the
cow
in
two
and
give
half
to
each.
I
want
them
to
stop
complaining.”
&nbsp;
“Uh
sire,
it
is
a
cow,”
whispered
Chintamani.
“Cutting
it
in
two
might
not
be
a
good
idea.”
&nbsp;
One
of
his
jobs
was
to
make
sure
the
king
did
not
issue
any
crazy
orders,
which
Petuchand
was
quite
capable
of
doing
when
he
was
hungry
or
tired.
The
worry
had
made
Chintamani
bald
before
his
time.

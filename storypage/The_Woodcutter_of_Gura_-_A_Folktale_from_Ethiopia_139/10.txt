“Nonsense!
In
any
case,
the
priest
didn’t
see
you
after
you
fell,
so…”
began
his
wife.
&nbsp;
“Nag!
Nag!
Nag!”
said
the
woodcutter
getting
up
from
the
ground
in
disgust.
He
picked
up
his
axe
and
went
out
of
the
house.
&nbsp;
“Where
are
you
going?”
asked
his
wife.
&nbsp;
“To
get
some
firewood
so
that
you
can
cook
dinner,”
he
said,
walking
away.
&nbsp;
“What
a
fine
man!”
murmured
his
friends.
“Even
when
he’s
dead
he
doesn’t
forget
his
duty!”

And
that
is
why
it
is
often
said,
“A
fool
always
finds
one
still
more
foolish
to
admire
him!”

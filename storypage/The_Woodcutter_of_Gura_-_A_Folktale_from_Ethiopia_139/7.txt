“Send
for
my
wife,
of
course!”
the
woodcutter
cut
in
angrily.
&nbsp;
“Right
away,
brother!
Who
would
have
thought
that
a
dead
man
could
come
up
with
such
a
clever
idea!”
marveled
his
friends,
and
they
promptly
sent
for
his
wife.
Sobbing
and
wailing,
the
woodcutter’s
wife
appeared,
and
many
of
the
villagers
followed
her
into
the
house.

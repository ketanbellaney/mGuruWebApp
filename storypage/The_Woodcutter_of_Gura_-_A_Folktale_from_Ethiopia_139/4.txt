The
priest
is
indeed
a
very
wise
man,
so
whatever
he
says
must
be
true.
Ah,
me!
Then
I
must
be
dead!”
&nbsp;
It
did
not
take
the
woodcutter
long
to
convince
himself
that
he
was
really
dead.
So
he
just
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
on
the
ground
without
moving.
After
a
while,
his
friends
came
along
and
called
out
to
him,
but
the
woodcutter
lay
perfectly
still.
They
shook
him
and
splashed
water
on
his
faced.
But
the
woodcutter
neither
spoke
nor
moved
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
quite
dead.
&nbsp;
They
tried
to
make
him
stand,
but
the
woodcutter
thought
to
himself,
“Surely,
a
dead
man
can’t
stand
up!”
and
promptly
fell
down
again.
Now
his
friends
too
were
convinced
that
he
was
dead.
So
they
lifted
him
up
and
began
to
carry
him
back
to
the
village.
“Pick
up
my
axe!”
shouted
the
woodcutter,
and
they
did.
&nbsp;
Soon
they
came
to
a
fork
in
the
path
and
there
they
stopped.
Should
they
turn
right
or
left?
The
friends
stood
there
and
began
to
argue
long
and
loud.

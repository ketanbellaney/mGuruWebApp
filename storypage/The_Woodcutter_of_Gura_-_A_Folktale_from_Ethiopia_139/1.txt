One
sunny
morning,
the
woodcutter
of
Gura
set
out
to
get
some
firewood.
He
walked
across
the
plain
until
he
came
to
the
great
big
olive
tree
by
the
river.


He
climbed
the
tree
and
perched
himself
at
the
end
of
the
largest
branch.
Then
he
made
himself
comfortable,
swung
his
axe,
and
began
to
cut
the
branch
on
which
he
was
sitting.
&nbsp;
The
village
priest,
who
was
passing
by,
looked
up
at
the
woodcutter
and
stopped
to
talk
to
him.
“Brother,
what
are
you
doing?”
he
cried.
“That’s
no
way
to
chop
wood!”
“What
other
way
is
there?”
answered
the
woodcutter.
“If
you
want
wood,
you
must
lift
your
axe
and
keep
going
chop-chop-chop!"
&nbsp;
“But
you’re
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
branch
and
chopping
it
in
the
middle!
The
branch
will
break,
and
when
it
does,
you’ll
fall
down
and
die,”
warned
the
priest.

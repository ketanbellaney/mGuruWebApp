&nbsp;Suddenly,
there
was
a
mighty
loud
c-r-a-c-k,
and
down
crashed
the
branch,
the
man
and
his
axe!
&nbsp;
As
he
lay
on
the
ground,
dazed
and
bewildered
and
aching
everywhere,
the
woodcutter
remembered
his
conversation
with
the
priest.
&nbsp;
“The
priest
said
three
things
–
that
the
branch
would
break,
that
I
would
fall…and
be
killed.
The
priest
was
right.
The
branch
broke
just
as
he
said
it
would,
and
I
fell
too.

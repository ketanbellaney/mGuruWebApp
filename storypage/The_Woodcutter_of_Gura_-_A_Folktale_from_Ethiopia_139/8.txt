“A
branch
fell
on
him
and
killed
him,”
the
friends
began
to
explain.
&nbsp;
“No!
No!
No!”
exclaimed
the
woodcutter,
“How
many
times
am
I
to
tell
you
I
was
sitting
on
the
branch
and
it
broke?”
&nbsp;
“But
my
husband
is
talking!
How
can
he
be
dead!
What
happened
to
him?”
cried
the
woodcutter’s
wife.
&nbsp;
“How…when…what….
Woman,
it’s
not
respectful
to
ask
the
dead
all
those
questions,”
said
the
friends.
&nbsp;
“I
tell
you
he
isn’t
dead
at
all,”
said
the
woodcutter’s
wife.
“Use
your
brains!”
&nbsp;
The
woodcutter
was
getting
irritated
now.
“The
wise
priest
told
me
the
branch
would
break,
and
I
would
surely
fall
down
and
die.
The
branch
broke
and
I
fell.
The
priest
was
speaking
the
truth.
So
I
must
be
dead.”

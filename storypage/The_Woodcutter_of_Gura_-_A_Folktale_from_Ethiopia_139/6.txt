The
woodcutter
got
so
irritated
that
he
sat
up
and
pointed
out
the
way.
Then
he
lay
down
and
shut
his
eyes
again.
And
his
friends
carried
him
to
the
village
saying,
“Ah,
what
a
clever
man!
He
always
knew
the
answer
to
everything.
What
a
pity
he’s
dead!”
&nbsp;
Soon
they
reached
the
woodcutter’s
house,
but
found
no
one
at
home.
So
they
put
him
on
the
floor
and
began
to
argue
about
what
they
should
do
next.

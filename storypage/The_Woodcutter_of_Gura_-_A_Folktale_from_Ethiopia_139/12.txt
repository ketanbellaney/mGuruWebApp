RAFT&nbsp;
CRAFT
What
do
you
think
the
woodcutter
of
Gura
was
chopping
wood
for?
Perhaps
to
light
a
fire
and
cook
his
food.
What
other
uses
of
wood
can
you
think
of?
Do
you
know
that
people
sail
across
lakes
and
rivers
in
rafts
made
with
logs
of
wood
tied
together?
How
about
making
your
own
toy
raft?
It’s
easy
–
grab
some
sticks
or
twigs…
and
get,
set,
and
sail
away!

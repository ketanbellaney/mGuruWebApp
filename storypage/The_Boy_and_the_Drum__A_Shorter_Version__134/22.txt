The
groom’s
father
said:

Groom’s
father:&nbsp;You
see,
son,
it’s
like
this.
We
are
all
set
to
go
in
the
wedding
procession.
But
we
need
a
horse
for
the
groom.
The
man
who
was
supposed
to
bring
it
hasn’t
turned
up,
the
auspicious
hour
is
almost
gone.


And
the
groom
himself
stepped
up
to
the
boy
and
said:
Groom:&nbsp;I
am
the
groom.


Waiting
to
see
my
bride,
But
I’m
stuck
in
here
Just
hoping
for
a
ride!
I
just
can’t
go
there
on
my
feet.
My
horse
is
late
and
so
is
the
hour.
My
guests
are
all
waiting
to
eat.
I’ll
miss
my
wedding
for
sure!
So
you
see,
what
I
need
right
now
is
a
horse!
I
need
a
horse!
A
really
quick
horse!
&nbsp;
Chorus:&nbsp;He
needs
a
horse,
he
needs
a
horse!He
needs
a
really
fast
horse!

The
little
boy
skipped
along
until
he
came
upon
a
strange
scene
at
the
river
bank.
&nbsp;
A
washerman
was
quarreling
loudly
with
his
wife.
&nbsp;
The
boy
stopped
and
asked:
Boy:&nbsp;Dear
Sir,
what
is
the
matter?
Why
are
you
quarreling
with
your
wife?


Narrator:&nbsp;The
washerman
said:
&nbsp;
Washerman:&nbsp;You
see,
son,
it
was
like
this,
I
gave
her
a
pot,
I
gave
her
a
pot.
And
what
did
she
do?
I
gave
her
a
pot,
it
cost
a
lot.
She
went
and
broke
it
too!
I
gave
her
the
pot
that
cost
a
lot.
Itâ€™ll
cost
me
all
the
more.
She
broke
the
pot,
the
last
of
my
lot,
And
now
I
feel
so
sore!

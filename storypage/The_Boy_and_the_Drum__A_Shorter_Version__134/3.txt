The
mother
knew
she
would
never
have
enough
money
to
buy
a
drum
for
her
son.
She
went
to
the
market,
sold
her
grain
and
bought
some
gram
flour
and
some
salt.


While
returning
home,
she
felt
sad
that
she
would
have
to
face
him
empty-handed.
So
when
she
saw
a
nice
piece
of
wood
on
the
road,
she
picked
it
up
and
brought
it
home.
&nbsp;
The
son
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
piece
of
wood.
Yet
he
happily
carried
it
with
him
when
he
went
out
to
play.

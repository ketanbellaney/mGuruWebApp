The
boy
was
very
happy
and
led
the
horse
along,
singing
his
song.


Boy:&nbsp;Oh
so
funny
indeed!
People
looking
for
things,


And
I
have
what
they
need!
A
man
needs
a
shirt,
But
all
he
has
is
a
big
fine
horse!
I
gave
him
my
coat,
what
did
I
get?
His
big
fine
horse,
of
course!


As
he
was
walking
along
with
his
horse,
he
came
upon
a
large
party
of
gaily
dressed
people.
They
were
part
of
a
big
wedding
party
with
the
bridegroom,
and
musicians.
They
seemed
ready
to
go
in
a
wedding
procession,
but
all
of
them
were
sitting
under
a
tree
with
long
faces.


The
boy
stopped
and
asked
them
what
made
them
look
so
depressed.

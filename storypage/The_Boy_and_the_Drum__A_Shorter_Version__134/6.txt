And
as
he
went
skipping
along
on
his
way,
he
came
across
an
old
man.
The
old
man
was
trying
to
light
his
stove
using
some
cow-dung
cakes.
The
fire
was
not
catching
and
there
was
smoke
all
around.
The
smoke
made
the
man's
eyes
water
and
he
was
coughing.
The
little
boy
ran
up
to
him
and
said:
&nbsp;
Boy:&nbsp;What
is
the
matter
Grandpa?
Can
I
help
you
in
any
way?
&nbsp;
Old
Man:&nbsp;Ah!
Little
one,
I
am
trying
to
cook
some
food,
but
I
am
unable
to
start
a
fire.
For
you
see,
My
fire
will
just
not
start
I
need
to
cook.
Oh!
Take
a
look
My
fire
will
never
start!
Can
somebody
start
this
fire?
My
eyes
are
red,
my
arms
are
tired.


I
need
to
eat,
I
need
some
food.
Oh!
For
a
dry
piece
of
wood!

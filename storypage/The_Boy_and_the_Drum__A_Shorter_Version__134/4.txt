A
happy
song
sprang
to
his
lips
and
he
went
along
singing
it:



Boy:&nbsp;Tum-ti-tee
Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee
Tot
Tum-ti-tee
Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee
Tot!
I
asked
for
a
drum
and
look
what
I
got,
A
lovely
piece
of
wood!

asked
for

I

my

is

Tum-ti-tee

The
boy
walked
on,
all
the
while
admiring
his
grand
coat.
He
soon
came
to
a
bridge,
and
there
he
was
alarmed
by
what
he
saw.

A
man
was
shivering
in
the
cold
and
he
was
not
even
wearing
a
shirt.
He
seemed
to
be
hurt
and
was
moaning
in
pain.
The
boy
was
very
concerned
and
ran
up
to
the
man
and
said:
&nbsp;
Boy:&nbsp;You
seem
to
be
bleeding,
You
seem
to
be
hurt!
I'll
try
and
get
you
some
help.
You
also
need
a
coat.
&nbsp;
The
boy
asked
the
man
how
he
came
to
be
in
such
a
sorry
state.

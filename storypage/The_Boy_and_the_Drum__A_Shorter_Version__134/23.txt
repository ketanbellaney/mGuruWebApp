And
so
the
boy,
being
helpful
as
ever,
offered
his
horse
to
the
groom.
The
groom
was
very
happy
and
he
asked
the
boy
what
he
could
give
him
in
exchange
for
his
horse.
&nbsp;
The
boy
looked
around
among
the
musicians
and
quickly
spotted
the
drummer.
&nbsp;
He
said:
Boy:&nbsp;A
stitch
in
time
they
say
saves
nine.
And
what
indeed
did
save
the
day,


Was
this
splendid
horse
of
mine!


All
I
want
from
you
is
That
fine
little
drum
that
you
play!
Oh,
make
my
dreams
come
true!


Please
make
my
dream
come
true!


The
groom
requested
the
drummer
to
hand
over
the
drum
to
the
boy.
The
drummer
knew
he
would
easily
get
enough
money
to
buy
himself
a
brand
new
drum.
He
willingly
gave
his
drum
away.

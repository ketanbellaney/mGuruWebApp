I
gave
her
the
pot,
the
pot
she
broke.
The
pot
I
need
to
boil
my
clothes.


Without
the
pot,
my
clothes
will
rot.


Oh,
they
will
remain
soiled!
So
you
see,
I
have
nothing
to
boil
my
clothes
in
before
I
wash
them.
And
because
of
her,
my
trade
will
suffer.


Boy:&nbsp;Dear
Sir,
don’t
quarrel
with
your
wife.
Please
take
this
pot
of
mine
and
use
it.
&nbsp;
The
washerman
was
very
happy
with
the
pot.
He
was
so
pleased
with
the
boy’s
good
nature
that
he
gave
him
a
nice
coat
in
return.
The
boy
ran
along
singing
his
funny
song.


Boy:&nbsp;As
I
walked
along,
With
my
pot
in
hand,


I
met
a
washerman.
Who
gave
me
this
coat
so
grand!
Oh
so
funny
indeed!
People
looking
for
things,
And
I
have
what
they
need!

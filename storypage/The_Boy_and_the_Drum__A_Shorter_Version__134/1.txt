A
poor
woman
had
a
son.
She
worked
hard
as
a
gardener
in
wealthy
houses
in
their
town.
They
gave
her
some
grain
in
return.
&nbsp;
But
she
felt
bad
because
she
could
never
afford
to
buy
nice
clothes
or
lovely
toys
for
her
son.
&nbsp;
The
little
lad
was
bright
and
cheerful.
Not
having
any
toys
or
nice
clothes
did
not
bother
him.
After
a
hard
day's
work,
the
mother
was
going
to
the
market
to
sell
the
grain
she
had
received.
&nbsp;
She
asked
her
son:
Mother:&nbsp;What
can
I
get
for
you
from
the
market,
little
one?


Now
the
boy
was
fascinated
with
the
sound
of
a
drum.
So
he
said:
Boy:&nbsp;A
drum,
mother,
I
would
love
to
have
a
drum
to
play
with.

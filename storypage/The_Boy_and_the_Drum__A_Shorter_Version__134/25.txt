The
boy
rushed
home
singing
his
song
and
playing
his
new
drum.
He
could
not
wait
to
tell
his
mother
how
she
had
helped
him
to
get
his
drum.


Boy:&nbsp;My
piece
of
wood
did
a
lot
of
good!
It
got
me
bread
as
food.
My
piece
of
bread
lasted
not,


But
gave
me
a
lovely
pot.
My
pot
got
me
a
lovely
coat.
The
coat
did
help
a
needy
man.
I
got
me
a
big
fine
horse
to
ride.
With
that
horse,
I
got
a
groom
his
bride!
So
you
see
it
is
simple
indeed


A
little
bit
of
give
and
take,
Will
a
lot
of
people
happy
make!
So
when
you
meet
your
friends
today,
Try
and
make
their
day!

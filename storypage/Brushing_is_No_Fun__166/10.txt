“There’s
something
we
should
do
first!”
reminded
Riya.
“Tidy
UP!”
Rohan
yawned.
“Do
we
have
to?”

“Remember
you
couldn’t
find
your
ball
the
other
day?
Putting
things
away
in
the
proper
place
makes
it
easy
to
find
them
later!”

“And
keeps
our
house
neat!”



“You
both
are
so
smart!”
said
Papa
proudly.
“Bedtime!”

“Papa!
There’s
something
we
should
do
first!”
said
Riya,
pulling
Rohan
along.


“Make
the
germs
disappear
with
our
magic
secret!”
Rohan
nodded.

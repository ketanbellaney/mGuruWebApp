Germs
say,
yucky,
mucky
and
dirty
is
FUN!

I
say,
I
brush
and
wash
and
I
know
I
have
won!

Germs
say,
never
bathe,
it’s
a
waste
of
time!

I
say,
smelling
nice
with
soap
is
so
fine.

Naughty
germ
says
don’t
pick
up
your
things,


The
house
looks
better
that
way.

I
say,
I
tidy
up
because
I
like
my
things

That
is
a
good
way
to
end
my
day!

And
I
feel
better
in
every
way

I
feel
better
in
every
way!


I
FEEL
BETTER
IN
EVERY
WAY!!!!!

Now
make
up
your
secret
song
and
hum
it

when
you
have
to
do
boring
things!

Later
Riya
showed
Rohan
the
proper
way
to
wash
hands.&nbsp;


“Wet
your
hands
and
turn
off
the
tap.
Then
rub
in
some
soap
on
the
palms,
the
back
of
the
hands
and
between
the
fingers.
Scrub
hands
for
twenty
seconds!
Now,
it’s
time
to
rinse
off
and
dry!”

“But
that’s
a
long
time!”

“Remember
my
secret?”

Rohan
smiled.

“But
Jimmy
never
washes
his
hands!”



Riya
laughed,
“He
doesn’t
use
his
hands
or
paws
to
eat
like
we
do!&nbsp;We
must
wash
our
hands
with
soap
to
get
rid
of
germs.”

“Are
germs
on
our
hands
too?”


“Germs
are
EVERYWHERE!”

WOOF!



“Aaaah-chhhooo!”
Riya
covered
her
mouth
with
her
hands
as
she
sneezed.


“Don't
do
that!
My
teacher
says
that
we
should
sneeze
into
our
sleeve,
not
our
hands!"
said
Rohan.


“Why?”

“Because
when
we
sneeze
into
our
hands,
germs
stick
to
them.
If
we
don’t
wash
our
hands,
we
spread
germs
and
make
others
sick!”

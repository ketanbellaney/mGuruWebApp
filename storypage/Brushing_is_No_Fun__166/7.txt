When
they
came
back
home
after
playing,
Riya
nudged
Rohan,&nbsp;“There’s
something
we
should
do
first!”


Mummy
teased,
“Play
some
more?”

“TAKE
A
BATH!”

“Mummy,
don’t
you
know
that
germs
are
everywhere?
We
can’t
see
them,
but
they
stick
to
our
skin
and
clothes!”

“That’s
why
we
must
bathe
every
day…”

“…to
get
rid
of
them!”

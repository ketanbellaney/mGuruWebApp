“I
don’t
want
to
brush
my
teeth!
Jimmy
doesn’t
brush
his
teeth!”

“Animals
take
care
of
their
teeth
too,
but
in
other
ways!
We
must
brush
our
teeth
to
keep
germs
away!”

“Germs?”


“Germs
are
very
tiny
creatures
that
you
cannot
see.
If
you
don’t
brush
properly,
they
stay
in
your
mouth
and
hurt
you!”



“Ouch!”
“YES!
That’s
why
we
must
take
good
care
of
our
teeth
by
brushing
twice
a
day
-
morning
and
night!”


“But
brushing
is
no
fun!”


“I’ll
tell
you
a
secret,
Rohan!
Psst…”

Rohan
smiled.

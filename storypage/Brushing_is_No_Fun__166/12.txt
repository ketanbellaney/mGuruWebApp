A
few
minutes
later,
Mummy
and
Papa
heard
a
familiar
tune.&nbsp;
“So
that’s
your
secret!”
said
Papa.
“Humming
a
song
to
make
brushing
fun!”

“And
while
washing
our
hands
too!”

“That’s
a
great
idea!”
said
Mummy.

WOOF!

Rohan
and
Riya
enjoy
taking
care
of
themselves.
Do
you?&nbsp;
They
make
up
a
game
with
the
germs
and
guess
who
wins?

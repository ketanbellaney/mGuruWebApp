Before
Master
Ming
could
react,
Mrs.
Chang
spoke.
“I
got
a
letter
from
my
son
in
Beijing
this
morning.
I
don’t
know
how
to
read,
so
I
asked
Warrior
Wen
to
read
it
out
for
me.
But
he
began
crying
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
letter.Something
terrible
must
have
happened
to
my
son!
Something
awful,
horrible,
unimaginable…
O
my
poor
Chen,
poor,
poor
Chen….
Booo….
Hoooo…..”

&nbsp;
Even
as
an
exasperated
Master
Ming
consoled
old
Mrs.
Chang,
Warrior
Wen
bravely
fought
back
his
tears
and
opened
his
mouth.
“To
tell
you
the
truth,
Master,
I
didn’t
read
my
books
very
well
when
I
was
in
school.
I
never
paid
any
attention
to
my
teachers
and
to
my
lessons,
so
I
still
don’t
know
how
to
read.
I
am
so
ashamed
of
myself!
Bawwwwww……….”
he
wailed.




Master
Ming
was
dumbstruck!

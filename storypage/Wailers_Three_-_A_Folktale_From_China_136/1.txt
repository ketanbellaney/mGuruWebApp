One
day
old
Mrs.
Chang
in
the
village
got
a
letter.
It
was
from
her
son
Chen,
who
lived
far
away
in
Beijing.
She
could
not
read,
so
she
waited
in
front
of
her
house
for
someone
to
come
by
who
could
read
out
the
letter
to
her.&nbsp;
After
some
time,
Warrior
Wen
came
by,
swinging
his
exquisitely
carved
staff.
Old
Mrs.
Chang
stopped
him
and
said,
“O
brave
warrior,
could
you
do
me
a
favour
and
read
out
this
letter
from
my
son
to
me?”
Warrior
Wen
immediately
agreed.

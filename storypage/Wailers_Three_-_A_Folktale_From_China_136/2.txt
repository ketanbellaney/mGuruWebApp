He
took
the
letter
from
the
old
lady
and
opened
it.
Mrs.
Chang
sat
down
in
eager
anticipation
of
news
from
her
dear
son.
But
one
look
at
the
letter
and
Warrior
Wen
began
to
wail
loudly.
“What
is
it,
Warrior
Wen?
What
is
it?
Tell
me,
is
something
wrong
with
my
son?”
asked
old
Mrs.
Chang
anxiously.
But
Warrior
Wen
didn’t
say
a
word
–
he
only
looked
up
at
her
and
began
to
wail
even
louder
than
before.

Hearing
the
cacophonic
cries,
Master
Ming,
whose
school
was
just
around
the
corner
from
Mrs.
Chang’s
house,
came
rushing
out.
Several
curious
kids
followed
suit
–
some
giggling,
some
chattering,
some
whispering,
but
all
delighted
that
their
class
had
been
interrupted!
&nbsp;
When
Master
Ming
saw
the
weeping
chorus,
he
ran
up
to
them
worriedly.
What
could
have
gone
so
terribly
wrong,
he
wondered,
as
he
sprinted
down
the
road.
“Booooooooo……
hoooooooooooo….
Waaaaaaaaaaaa…..”
came
the
response.
&nbsp;
Master
Ming
was
beginning
to
lose
his
patience.
“Out
with
it
you
howling
hyenas!”
he
thundered.
Taken
aback
by
his
roar
that
was
even
louder
than
their
waaaaaa...ils,
Peddler
Peng
was
the
first
to
answer.

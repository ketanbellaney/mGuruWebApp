“Sniff…
sob…
Just
a
year
ago,”
he
said,
and
wiped
his
running
nose,
“I
had
made
a
hundred
earthen
pots
to
be
sold
in
the
market.
But
as
I
was
on
my
way,
the
donkey
that
was
carrying
them
got
frightened
by
his
own
shadow
and
started
to
bray
loudly!
&nbsp;
And
my
pots,
they
all
came
tumbling
down
one
by
one
and
broke
into
a
million
pieces.
Not
even
one
beautiful
pot
was
left
unbroken.
I
was
so
upset.
I
wanted
to
cry
and
cry
and
cry
then,
but
I
couldn’t
do
it
because
I
had
to
immediately
think
up
ways
to
make
up
for
my
losses.
So
I
postponed
it.
&nbsp;
Today,
when
I
saw
the
two
of
them
crying,
I
was
reminded
of
that
heartbreaking
episode
and
decided
to
cry
for
my
precious,
pretty
pots.
Waaaaaa….”

At
once,
the
ground
shuddered,
and
dogs
nearby
took
to
their
heels!
&nbsp;
Soon
Loco
was
far
from
its
home.
Seeing
a
big
bull
sitting
on
the
track,
Loco
was
so
scared
that
it
let
out
a
piercing
shriek,
“Oooo!”
And
the
bull
lifted
its
tail
and
sprang
away,
its
legs
flaying
about
wildly
as
it
ran
for
dear
life.

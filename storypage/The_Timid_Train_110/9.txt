Deep
inside
a
dark
cave
in
the
mountains.
Babu,
the
driver
didn’t
even
flinch
as
he
merrily
punched
some
buttons
to
switch
on
the
engine
lights,
but
Loco
was
horrified.
“Noooo,
I
don’t
want
to
go
in
there,”
it
wailed,
but
it
just
came
out
as
a
great
long
whistle.
Through
the
deep
cavern
hurtled
dear
Loco,
its
great
beams
lighting
the
pitch
black
tunnel.

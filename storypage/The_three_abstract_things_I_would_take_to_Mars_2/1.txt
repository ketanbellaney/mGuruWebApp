One
fine
day,
on
a
cheerful
sunny
morning,
I
got
up
of
the
bed
with
a
wonderful
kick
start.
I
started
with
my
usual
bachelor
life-
getting
up,
take
a
cool
wonderful
splash
of
cold
water;
just
to
drive
away
the
drowsiness,
have
a
hot
cup
of
coffee
and
finally;
head
straight
for
college.
That
day,
while
I
was
locking
the
door
of
my
house,
I
found
a
strange
letter.
My
curiosity
grew
and
with
shaking
hands,
I
opened
the
letter
which
was
from
NASA.
I
found
that
I
had
a
golden
opportunity
to
visit
Mars!
Along
with
it
there
was
a
small
note
saying:
-
“Only
three
abstract
things
should
be
carried
to
the
Red
Planet.”
Oh
no!
I
didn’t
expect
that.
No
problem.
Everything’s
possible.
So
I
began
to
pen
down
a
huge
list
of
abstract
things.
Finally,
I
decided
my
3
abstract
things:
Extraterrestrial
life,
Beauty
and
at
last,
HOPE.
A
week
later,
with
a
crew
of
five
scientists,
I
started
off
to
Mars.
When
we
landed,
we
started
setting
up
our
experiments.
At
first,
we
decided
to
start
with
alien
life.
With
a
small
explosion,
we
met
the
first
alien
of
Mars.
It
waved
its
hand
at
me
and
me
at
him.
Soon,
we
planted
small
seeds
on
the
surface
of
Mars.
With
our
hopes
rising
with
the
small
little
shoots,
we
finally
decided
to
return
to
our
Mother
Earth.
Today,
‘I’
am
famous
as
the
person
who
breathed
life
into
Mars.
That
day
onwards
till
date,
I
sit
on
my
verandah
with
a
huge
telescope
and
watch
the
trees
growing
and
the
aliens
playing
happily
on
Mars.
It
gives
me
immense
pleasure
and
makes
me
feel
satisfied
with
mys

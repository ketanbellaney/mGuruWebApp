This
GREAT
force,
this
GIGANTIC
force
With
which
the
earth
pulls
us
All
of
us,
Even
the
penguins
at
the
edge
of
the
earth,
Towards
itself
Is
called
GRA-VI-TY.
Can
it
be
true,
sister,
can
it
be
true?
I
can’t
say,
little
brother,
I
can’t
say.
But
in
all
the
books
that
I
have
read
That
is
what
they
said.

Why
don’t
things
fall
up?&nbsp;
About
350
years
ago,
a
famous
English
scientist
called
Isaac
Newton
was
relaxing
under
an
apple
tree
when
an
apple
fell
and
hit
him
SMACK!
on
the
head.
Rubbing
his
sore
head,
Newton
wondered
why
things
never
fell
up.
Finally,
he
came
up
with
the
theory
that
the
earth
was
like
a
giant
magnet,
which
attracted
everything
around
it
with
great
force.
He
called
this
invisible
force
‘gravity’.
&nbsp;
He
also
concluded
that
everything
in
the
universe
attracts
everything
else.
Bigger
objects
attract
each
other
with
greater
force
than
smaller
ones.
Also,
as
the
distance
between
two
objects
increases,
the
force
of
attraction
between
them
decreases.

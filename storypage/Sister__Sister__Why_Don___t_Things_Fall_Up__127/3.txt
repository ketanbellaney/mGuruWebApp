I
think
The
old
woman
who
lives
in
the
sky
Got
so
tired
of
cleaning
the
mess
That
she
put
a
curse
on
the
earth;
And
things
have
fallen
down
ever
since.
&nbsp;
I
think
that’s
why
things
don’t
fall
up
Because
the
old
woman
in
the
sky
Was
fed
up
of
living
in
a
smelly
pigsty.
I’m
clever,
aren’t
I,
sister?

Gravity,
however,
does
not
just
make
apples
fall
down
from
trees.
It
also
keeps
the
moon
in
orbit
around
the
earth
and
all
the
planets
in
orbit
around
the
sun.
The
force
of
the
earth’s
gravity
keeps
the
moon
from
flying
away
into
space.

&nbsp;
But
why
doesn’t
the
moon
fall
towards
the
earth?
Because
the
moon
has
its
own
gravity,
with
which
it
attracts
the
earth.
It
is
because
the
earth’s
gravity
is
greater,
that
the
moon
goes
around
the
earth.
If
the
moon’s
was
greater,
the
earth
would
have
gone
around
the
moon
instead!

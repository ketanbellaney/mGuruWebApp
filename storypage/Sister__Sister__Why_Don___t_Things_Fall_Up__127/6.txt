Mother
prayed
to
all
her
Gods.One
of
them
took
pity
on
her,
And
things
fell
down
and
vanished
no
more.
&nbsp;Mother
was
happy
(for
a
while)
Now
she
complains
about
the
mess
on
the
floor.
I
think
that’s
why
things
don’t
fall
up
All
thanks
to
a
woman’s
pleas
For
fewer
lost
coins,
and
screws,
and
keys.
I’m
clever,
aren’t
I,
sister?

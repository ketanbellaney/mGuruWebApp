Why
does
this
happen?

Because
there
is
a
tension
force
in
the
string,
which
keeps
the
ball
turning
around
your
head.
When
you
let
go
of
the
string,
the
tension
force
disappears
and
the
ball
goes
flying.
&nbsp;
Now
imagine
the
ball
is
the
moon
and
you
are
the
earth.
The
earth's
gravity
is
like
the
tension
force
in
the
string!
If
this
tension
force
did
not
exist,
the
moon
would
fly
away
into
space!

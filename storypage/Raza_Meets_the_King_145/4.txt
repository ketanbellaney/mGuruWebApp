After
a
while
the
guard
returned
with
another
man.
Rahmat
bowed
to
him.
“I’ve
brought
the
summer
clothes,
Dhaniji,”
he
said.
&nbsp;
“Good!
Come
with
me.
His
Majesty
is
still
in
his
sleeping
chamber.
He’ll
see
you
before
he
leaves
for
the
royal
court.”

As
they
walked
in,
Raza
whispered,
“Who
is
he,
Abbu?”
&nbsp;“Dhani
Singh.
He
works
in
the
Khwabgah.”
&nbsp;“Khwabgah?”
&nbsp;“The
king’s
personal
palace,
where
he
has
his
sitting
room
and
bedroom.”
&nbsp;
It
was
a
long
walk.
Raza
looked
around,
his
eyes
wide
with
wonder.
The
Mughal
palaces
were
so
beautiful!
All
made
of
red
sandstone
with
slim
carved
pillars
and
curving
arches.

Raza
and
his
father
then
tried
one
patka
after
another
–
green
and
yellow,
orange
and
purple,
but
nothing
pleased
Akbar.
&nbsp;
“I
don’t
like
any
of
the
colours,
Rahmat!”
Akbar
said,
frowning
impatiently.
Raza
saw
that
his
father
was
beginning
to
look
worried.
Oh
no!
If
His
Majesty
did
not
like
the
patkas,
would
he
send
all
the
clothes
back?
“I
have
to
do
something
fast!”
Raza
thought.
&nbsp;
He
looked
around
and
said
suddenly,
“Huzoor,
would
you
like
to
try
a
bright
red
one
with
a
white
and
yellow
design?”
“What
kind
of
red?”
Akbar
boomed.
“Show
me!”
Raza
pointed
to
Dhani
Singh’s
turban,
“That
red?”
“Hmmm…”
Akbar
stared
thoughtfully
at
Dhani
Singh’s
moustached
face
and
said,
“Let
me
give
it
a
try.”

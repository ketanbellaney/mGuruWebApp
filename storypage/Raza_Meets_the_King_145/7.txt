“Your
turban
is
very
nice,
Dhaniji,”
he
said,
“that’s
a
really
pretty
design!”
&nbsp;
“Thank
you!
I
come
from
the
land
of
the
Rajputs
and...
this
design,
called
bandhani,
is
from
my
homeland.”

As
they
entered
the
room,
Raza’s
heart
was
thudding.
Sunlight
poured
in
through
the
arched
doorways,
lighting
up
the
thick
silken
Persian
carpet
woven
in
jewelled
colours.
The
room
was
furnished
with
a
beautifully
carved
bed
and
exquisite
chairs.
There
were
silk
and
gold
cushions
on
the
low
bed.
Even
the
curtains
were
made
of
silk!


Raza
bowed
and
then
looked
at
his
king.
Akbar
was
choosing
jewellery
from
a
box
held
before
him
by
a
servant.

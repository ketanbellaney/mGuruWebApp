It
was
a
very
special
day
and
so
Raza
was
wearing
his
best
clothes.
Today,
he
was
going
to
meet
someone
very
important
–
His
Majesty
Jalaluddin
Akbar,
the
great
Mughal
king!
&nbsp;Raza’s
father
&nbsp;
Rahmat
Khan
was
an
important
man
too.
He
was
the
royal
tailor
to
the
king,
and
he
stitched
all
his
angarakhas
–
the
loose
coats
that
the
king
wore
over
his
tight
churidar
pyjamas.&nbsp;
This
morning
they
were
going
to
the
palace
in
Fatehpur
Sikri
with
the
angarakhas
the
king
had
ordered
for
summer.
The
king
was
very
fussy
about
his
clothes
and
it
was
very
hard
to
please
him.

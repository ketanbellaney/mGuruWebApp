In
between
were
gardens
filled
with
flowers,
lily
pools
and
sparkling
fountains.
Raza
thought
he
was
in
heaven.



As
they
waited
at
the
door
of
the
king’s
bedroom,
Raza
studied
Dhani
Singh.
Being
a
tailor’s
son,
he
noticed
the
clothes
first.
&nbsp;
Dhani
Singh
was
wearing
a
cotton
angarakha
in
a
red
and
white
flowery
print
over
white
churidars.
His
nagra
shoes
had
pointed
toes
that
curved
inward.
He
had
tied
a
narrow
cloth
belt,
a
patka,
at
his
waist.




What
Raza
liked
most
was
his
bright
red
turban,
printed
with
a
design
in
white
and
yellow
squares
and
dots.

They
were
made
of
the
finest
muslin
and
covered
with
delicate
embroidery.
All
of
them
were
in
light
summery
colours
–
cream,
lemon,
pale
blue,
green
and
a
sparkling
white.
Raza
knew
the
king’s
favourite
colour
was
white.
&nbsp;
Rahmat
helped
Akbar
put
on
a
white
angarakha.
Then
Dhani
Singh
brought
a
large
mirror
and
held
it
before
the
king.


“I
like
the
embroidery...
and
it
fits
well
too,”
Akbar
said,
looking
pleased.
“Now
tie
a
patka.
Let’s
see
how
it
looks.”
&nbsp;
Rahmat
took
out
a
handful
of
belts
and
tied
a
light
blue
one
around
Akbar’s
waist,
letting
the
fringed
ends
hang
in
front.

“No…”
said
Akbar
moodily,
“this
is
too
pale…
I
want
something
brighter.”

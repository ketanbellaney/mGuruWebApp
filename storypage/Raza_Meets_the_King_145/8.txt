He
was
not
very
tall
but
he
had
the
broad
shoulders
of
a
sword-fighter.
He
had
large,
slightly
slanted
eyes,
a
drooping
moustache,
and
a
small
mole
above
his
lips.




Hearing
them
enter,
Akbar
turned
and
smiled,
“Ah
Rahmat!
You’ve
brought
the
angarakhas?
And
who
is
this
boy
with
you?”
&nbsp;
“My
son
Raza,
huzoor.”
“And
can
you
stitch
too,
Raza?”
“I’m
learning,
huzoor,”
Raza
replied
nervously,
“but
I
still
make
mistakes
in
cutting
the
cloth.”
“You’ll
learn.
Your
father
will
teach
you,”
Akbar
said
gently.
&nbsp;
Rahmat
opened
the
bundle
and
laid
out
the
angarakhas
on
the
bed.

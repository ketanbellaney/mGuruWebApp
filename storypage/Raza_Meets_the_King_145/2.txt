Rahmat
Khan
had
worked
hard
to
make
the
angarakhas
–
cutting
and
stitching
late
into
the
night.
Raza
had
helped
too
–
putting
in
tiny
stitches
using
the
finest
needle
and
the
best
silken
thread.
&nbsp;
The
spring
sun
shone
brightly,
the
flowers
smiled,
and
the
pigeons
cooed
happily
as
the
two
of
them
walked
to
the
fortress
of
Fatehpur
Sikri.
Two
soldiers
holding
spears
stood
guarding
the
gate.


“I’m
Rahmat
Khan,”
Raza’s
father
said,
“I’m
the
angarakha
maker
to
His
Majesty
and
I’ve
brought
new
sets
for
him.”
&nbsp;
“Is
His
Majesty
expecting
you?”
the
guard
with
big
moustaches
asked.
“Ji
huzoor.
He
chose
the
designs
himself.”
“Wait
here,”
the
guard
turned
to
go
inside,
“I’ll
call
the
Royal
Steward.”

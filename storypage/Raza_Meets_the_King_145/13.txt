In
a
flash,
Raza
had
taken
off
Dhani
Singh’s
turban,
unrolled
it
and
tied
it
around
Akbar’s
waist.
He
waited
with
bated
breath
while
Akbar
studied
his
reflection
in
the
mirror.
He
noticed
Dhani
Singh
grinning
widely
–
he
must
have
been
amused
to
see
the
king
wearing
his
turban
as
a
belt!
&nbsp;
“I
like
the
colour…
and
a
new
design
too!”
Akbar
said
finally.
“Bandhani,
huzoor…
from
the
land
of
the
Rajputs,”
said
Raza
promptly.
&nbsp;
“Aha!
Rajput
like
my
queen,
Jodh
Bai!”
Akbar
began
to
smile.
“Dhani,
pay
Rahmat
for
the
angarakhas
and
patkas.
I’ll
take
them
all!”


“Huzoor,”
asked
Raza
cautiously,
“Dhaniji
needs
a
turban.
We’ve
taken
the
one
he
was
wearing.”
“Give
him
a
patka!”
laughed
Akbar.
“That
boring
pale
blue
one.
I
am
keeping
his
turban.”

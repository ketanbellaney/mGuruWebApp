Kaka,
really
hungry
now,
went
to
the
blacksmith
and
said
to
him,
“Oh
blacksmith
dear,
This
is
Kaka
here.
Give
me
a
sickle
To
give
the
grass
a
tickle.
I
will
take
her
with
me
For
the
buffalo
is
hungry
And
I
need
her
milk
For
the
dogs
to
feed
Whose
help
I
need
To
kill
the
deer
Whose
horn
I
shall
take
To
dig
some
mud
For
the
potter
to
make
A
cup
for
me
to
fill
With
water
to
wash
My
dirty
bill
So
I
can
eat
the
eggs
And
loudly
caw
To
let
everyone
Hear
me
and
know
That
I
am
the
most
handsome
crow.”

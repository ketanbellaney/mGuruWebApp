...a
pair
of
dogs.


“Oh
dogs
dear,
This
is
Kaka
here.
I
need
your
help,
I
fear,
To
kill
the
deer
Whose
horn
I
shall
take
To
dig
some
mud
For
the
potter
to
make
A
cup
for
me
to
fill
With
water
to
wash
My
dirty
bill
So
I
can
eat
the
eggs
And
loudly
caw
To
let
everyone
Hear
me
and
know
That
I
am
the
most
handsome
crow.”
&nbsp;
“That
is
a
lot
of
work
in
this
heat,”
grumbled
one
of
the
dogs.
“We
need
to
be
strong
to
kill
the
deer.
Go
get
some
milk
for
us
to
drink.”

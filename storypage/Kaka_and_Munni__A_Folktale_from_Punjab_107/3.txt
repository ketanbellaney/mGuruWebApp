Kaka
did
not
like
the
idea
of
not
looking
his
very
best.
He
quickly
flew
over
to
the
stream
and
was
about
to
wash
his
beak
in
the
water,
when
the
stream
cried
out,
“Kaka!
Wait!
If
you
dip
your
beak
into
me,
all
my
water
will
become
dirty.
Go
get
a
cup,
fill
it
with
water,
and
wash
your
beak
in
that.”

Back
to
the
village
flew
Kaka
and
went
to
the
buffalo
munching
on
some
straw.
“Oh
buffalo
dear,
This
is
Kaka
here.
Could
I
take
your
milk
To
the
dogs
to
feed
Whose
help
I
need
To
kill
the
deer
Whose
horn
I
shall
take
To
dig
some
mud
For
the
potter
to
make
A
cup
for
me
to
fill
With
water
to
wash
My
dirty
bill
So
I
can
eat
the
eggs
And
loudly
caw
To
let
everyone
Hear
me
and
know
That
I
am
the
most
handsome
crow?”


“If
I
could
get
some
lovely
juicy
grass
to
eat
instead
of
this
dry
hay,
I
would
certainly
give
you
milk,”
mooed
back
the
buffalo.

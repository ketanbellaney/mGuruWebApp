Off
Kaka
went
to
the
nearby
jungle
where
he
saw
a
deer
with
sharp
horns.
He
called
out
to
it,
&nbsp;
“My
friend,
oh
deer,
This
is
Kaka
here.
Your
horn
may
I
take
To
dig
some
mud
For
the
potter
to
make
A
cup
for
me
to
fill
With
water
to
wash
My
dirty
bill
So
I
can
eat
the
eggs
And
loudly
caw
To
let
everyone
Hear
me
and
know
That
I
am
the
most
handsome
crow?”
&nbsp;
“Oh,
you
very
clever
crow,
how
can
you
take
my
horn
while
I
am
still
alive?”
Kaka,
terribly
hungry,
flew
around
in
a
flurry
till
he
came
across...

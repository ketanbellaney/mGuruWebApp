Hearing
this,
Kaka
went
to
the
potter
in
the
village,
and
cawed
to
him,
&nbsp;
“Oh
potter
dear,
This
is
Kaka
here.
A
cup
you
make
For
me
to
fill
With
water
to
wash
My
dirty
bill
So
I
can
eat
the
eggs
And
loudly
caw
To
let
everyone
Hear
me
and
know
That
I
am
the
most
handsome
crow.”
&nbsp;
“I
will
gladly
give
you
a
cup,
but
I
need
mud
to
make
one
for
you,”
said
the
potter.

On
hearing
this,
Kaka
swooped
over
to
the
only
grassy
field
around
and
said
to
it,
“Oh
grass
dear,
This
is
Kaka
here.
Please
come
with
me
For
the
buffalo
is
hungry
And
I
need
her
milk
For
the
dogs
to
feed
Whose
help
I
need
To
kill
the
deer
Whose
horn
I
shall
take
To
dig
some
mud
For
the
potter
to
make
A
cup
for
me
to
fill
With
water
to
wash
My
dirty
bill
So
I
can
eat
the
eggs
And
loudly
caw
To
let
everyone
Hear
me
and
know
That
I
am
the
most
handsome
crow.”

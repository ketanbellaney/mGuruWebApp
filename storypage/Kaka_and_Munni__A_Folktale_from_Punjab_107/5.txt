So
Kaka
flew
over
to
the
nearby
field
and
said
to
it,
&nbsp;
“Oh
field
dear,
This
is
Kaka
here.
Some
mud
I’ll
take
For
the
potter
to
make
A
cup
to
fill
With
water
to
wash
My
dirty
bill
So
I
can
eat
the
eggs
And
loudly
caw
To
let
everyone
Hear
me
and
know
That
I
am
the
most
handsome
crow.”
&nbsp;
“I
am
all
dry
and
baked
hard,
for
the
monsoon
rains
are
yet
to
start.
Get
something
sharp
to
dig
me
up,”
replied
the
field.

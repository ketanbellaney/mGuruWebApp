In
a
gulmohar
tree
along
the
wheat
fields
in
Punjab,
Munni
the
sparrow,
sat
by
her
nest.
She
watched
over
her
three
little
eggs,
waiting
for
them
to
hatch.
Munni
looked
around
happily
at
the
bright
red
flowers,
before
giving
a
startled
chirp
as
she
saw
a
flash
of
black.
It
was
the
village
bully,
Kaka,
the
crow.
"Move
over
Munni,
for
I
have
come
to
eat
your
eggs,"
he
cawed.

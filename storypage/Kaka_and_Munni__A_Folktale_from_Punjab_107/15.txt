What&nbsp;
is&nbsp;
a&nbsp;
Collage?
&nbsp;
Each
of
the
pictures
that
you
have
seen
in
this
book
is
a
collage
(pronounced
ko–laaj).
Collage
is
a
way
of
making
a
whole
new
picture
by
putting
bits
of
material
together.
The
material
could
be
handmade
and
printed
paper,
like
in
this
book.
It
could
be
clippings
from
newspapers
and
magazines,
old
greeting
cards,
photographs,
fabric,
ribbons,
dried
flowers
and
leaves,
or
anything
else
that
you
find
lying
around!
&nbsp;
The
word
“collage”
comes
from
the
French
word
“colle”
meaning
“glue”.
To
make
a
collage,
you
need
bits
of
different
material,
a
scissor
or
a
pair
of
nimble
fingers
to
tear
up
stuff
and
lots
of
glue
to
stick
things
together.This
page
shows
the
four
elements,
Wind,
Water,
Earth
and
a
fiery
Sun,
and
uses
bits
from
paper
you
can
spot
in
the
book.
Now
go
ahead
and
make
your
own
collage!

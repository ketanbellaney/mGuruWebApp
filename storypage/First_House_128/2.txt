So
Kincha
Lali-Dam
and
Kindru-Lalim
came
out
of
their
caves
and
entered
a
dense
forest.The
first
animal
they
saw
was
an
elephant
standing
under
a
tree,
flapping
his
large
ears.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;“Can
you
tell
us
how
to
build
a
house,
O
mighty
one?”
they
asked.
The
elephant
trumpeted
loudly
and
said,
“Cut
logs
to
make
pillars
as
strong
and
thick
as
my
legs!”

Kindru-Lalim
and
Kincha
Lali-Dam
now
had
all
the
advice
they
needed
to
build
a
house
and
they
worked
very
hard
to
complete
it.
When
it
was
finally
done,
they
called
the
creatures
of
the
forest
to
come
and
have
a
look.
&nbsp;
“What
a
wonderful
house
you’ve
built!”
cried
everyone.
“And
now
it’s
all
yours
to
live
in!”

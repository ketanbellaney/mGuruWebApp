“It’s
not
only
ours
but
yours
as
well,
because
you’ve
helped
us
build
it!”cried
Kindru-Lalim
and
Kincha
Lali-Dam
happily.


The
sun
shone
brightly
in
the
sky,
a
breeze
whistled
softly
and
the
trees
swayed
gently
as
Kindru-Lalim
and
Kincha
Lali-Dam
stepped
into
their
new
house.
And
this
is
how
the
first
house
was
built
in
that
faraway
land
in
northeastern
India
known
today
as
Arunachal
Pradesh!

The&nbsp;
Singphos
&nbsp;
The
Singphos
live
in
the
Lohit
and
the
Changlang
districts
of
Arunachal
Pradesh.
Their
tribe
is
divided
into
a
number
of
clans
each
ruled
by
a
chief
known
as
Gam.
Unlike
other
hill
people
who
are
involved
in
jhum
(shifting)
cultivation,
the
Singphos
grow
tea.
&nbsp;
Singpho
women
wear
bright
woollen
skirts
and
black
jackets
with
silver
decorations
during
a
festival
called
Munao
Poi.
The
Singpho
men
wear
colourful
lungis
with
or
without
a
white
shirt
and
cover
their
heads
with
turbans.
&nbsp;
Singpho
houses
are
usually
double
storied
and
made
of
wood
or
bamboo.
They
are
oval
in
shape
and
the
lower
storey
is
used
as
a
stable
or
for
storing
food
while
the
upper
storey
becomes
the
family's
living
quarters.

The
first
house
was
built
in
a
faraway
land
of
the
East,
long,
long
ago
by
two
friends,
Kindru-Lalim
and
Kincha
Lali-Dam.
In
those
days,
people
still
lived
in
caves
and
did
not
know
what
a
house
was.

One
day,
Kindru-Lalim
remarked,
“O
Lali,
I’m
so
tired
of
living
in
a
dark
cave.
Why
don’t
we
build
a
house
in
the
forest?”

“That’s
a
fantastic
idea,
Kindru!”
exclaimed
Kincha
Lali-Dam.
“Let’s
go
and
ask
our
friends-
the
birds,
beasts
and
reptiles
how
to
build
a
house!”

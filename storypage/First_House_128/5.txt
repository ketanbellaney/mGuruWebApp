&nbsp;“I’m
much
too
sad
to
talk
now,”
said
the
mithun
sadly,
“but
I’ll
help
you
all
the
same.
You
see,
a
tiger
has
killed
my
husband,
so
make
a
roof
with
cross
poles,
like
the
bones
of
his
skeleton,”
added
the
mithun,
pointing
at
her
dead
mate.




Kincha
Lali-Dam
and
Kindru-Lalim
thanked
the
mithun
for
her
advice
and
began
making
cross
poles
out
of
the
bamboo,
but
they
soon
began
to
tire.

They
put
down
the
bamboo
poles
and
walked
to
a
nearby
river
to
have
a
drink.




Suddenly,
a
graceful
fish
swam
up
to
them
and
whispered,
“I
saw
from
afar
that
you
were
building
a
house!
Have
a
look
at
the
scales
on
my
back.
Collect
plenty
of
leaves
and
put
them
on
the
roof,
one
on
top
of
the
other,
like
my
scales.
That
will
protect
your
house
from
sun
and
rain,”
said
the
fish
and
she
gently
swam
away.

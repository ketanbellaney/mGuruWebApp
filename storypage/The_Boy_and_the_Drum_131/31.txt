Stage
setting:
The
boxes
below
suggest
a
possible
design
for
the
play.
Think
of
each
of
these
boxes
as
a
photograph
of
a
particular
scene.
You
could
have
the
props,
costumes,
and
musical
instruments
for
the
play
on
a
bench
placed
against
the
back
wall,
and
you
could
make
use
of
them
during
the
changing
of
the
scenes
behind
the
chorus.

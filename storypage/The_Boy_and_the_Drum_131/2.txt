Narrator:&nbsp;But
she
felt
bad
because
she
could
never
afford
to
buy
nice
clothes
or
lovely
toys
for
her
son.
&nbsp;
A
young
boy
comes
running
through
the
chorus,
singing
a
song
and
playing
mime
cricket.
He
freezes
with
a
pose
at
the
centre
of
the
stage.
&nbsp;
Narrator:&nbsp;The
little
lad
was
bright
and
cheerful.
Not
having
any
toys
or
nice
clothes
did
not
bother
him.
After
a
hard
day's
work,
the
mother
was
going
to
the
market
to
sell
the
grain
she
had
received.
&nbsp;
The
mother
steps
towards
the
boy
and
the
rest
of
the
frozen
actors
go
back
to
the
chorus.
&nbsp;
Narrator:&nbsp;She
asked
her
son:
Mother:&nbsp;What
can
I
get
for
you
from
the
market,
little
one?

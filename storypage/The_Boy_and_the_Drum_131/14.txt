Narrator:
The
little
boy
skipped
along
until
he
came
upon
a
strange
scene
at
the
river
bank.
The
chorus
can
move
their
hands
all
together,
symbolizing
the
flowing
river.
The
washerman
and
his
wife
emerge
from
the
chorus,
arguing
in
mime.
Their
actions
are
exaggerated
but
their
voices
are
not
heard.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
A
washerman
was
quarreling
loudly
with
his
wife.&nbsp;
The
boy
stopped
and
asked:
Boy:&nbsp;Dear
Sir,
what
is
the
matter?
Why
are
you
quarreling
with
your
wife?
Narrator:&nbsp;The
washerman
said:
&nbsp;
Washerman:&nbsp;You
see,
son,
it
was
like
this,
I
gave
her
a
pot,
I
gave
her
a
pot.


And
what
did
she
do?
I
gave
her
a
pot,
it
cost
a
lot.
She
went
and
broke
it
too!

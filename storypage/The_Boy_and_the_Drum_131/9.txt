For
you
see,
My
fire
will
just
not
start
I
need
to
cook.
Oh!
Take
a
look
My
fire
will
never
start!
Can
somebody
start
this
fire?


My
eyes
are
red,
my
arms
are
tired.


I
need
to
eat,
I
need
some
food.


Oh!
For
a
dry
piece
of
wood!



Boy:&nbsp;Here,
Grandpa,
you
can
use
my
piece
of
wood
to
start
your
fire.
&nbsp;
The
following
actions
are
mimed
as
the
narrator
speaks.
&nbsp;
Narrator:&nbsp;The
old
man
was
very
pleased.
He
lit
his
fire,
made
some
bread
and
gave
a
piece
to
the
boy.


The
old
man
steps
back
into
the
chorus.

Narrator:&nbsp;As
he
was
walking
along
with
his
horse,
he
came
upon
a
large
party
of
gaily
dressed
people.
They
were
part
of
a
big
wedding
party
with
the
bridegroom,
and
musicians.
They
seemed
ready
to
go
in
a
wedding
procession,
but
all
of
them
were
sitting
under
a
tree
with
long
faces.
&nbsp;
At
this
point,
both
the
groom’s
party
and
the
remaining
chorus
actors
sing
a
popular
wedding
song,
but
in
a
slow
and
sad-sounding
manner.
&nbsp;
The
boy
stopped
and
asked
them
what
made
them
look
so
depressed.
The
groom’s
father
said:
&nbsp;
Groom’s
father:&nbsp;You
see,
son,
it’s
like
this.
We
are
all
set
to
go
in
the
wedding
procession.

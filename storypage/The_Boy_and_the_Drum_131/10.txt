The
boy
skipped
along
singing
his
song:


Boy:
La-la-la-la-
La-la-la-la-
La-la-la-la-
LaLa-la-la-la-
La-la-la-la-
La-la-la-la-
La!


My
piece
of
wood
got
me
some
food.


A
lovely
piece
of
bread.
My
piece
of
wood
is
not
a
drum,
but
it
Got
me
bread.


A
lovely
piece
of
bread.
La-la-la-la-
La-la-la-la-
La-la-la-la-
LaLa-la-la-la-
La-la-la-la-
La-la-la-la-
La!



Narrator:&nbsp;The
boy
walked
on
till
he
came
upon
a
potter’s
wife.
She
had
her
baby
in
her
arms.
The
baby
was
wailing
and
flailing
her
arms.
&nbsp;
As
before,
the
potter’s
wife
emerges
from
the
chorus,
as
if
with
a
baby
in
her
arms.
While
the
mother
tries
to
pacify
the
baby,
the
chorus
hums
a
lullaby
softly.
This
lullaby
can
be
a
regional
song.

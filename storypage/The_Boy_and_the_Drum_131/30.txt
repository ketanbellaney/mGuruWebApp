Boy:
My
piece
of
wood
did
a
lot
of
good!


It
got
me
bread
as
food.
My
piece
of
bread
lasted
not,


But
gave
me
a
lovely
pot.


My
pot
got
me
a
lovely
coat.

The
coat
did
help
a
needy
man.


I
got
me
a
big
fine
horse
to
ride.
With
that
horse,
I
got
a
groom
his
bride!


So
you
see
it
is
simple
indeed


A
little
bit
of
give
and
take,


Will
a
lot
of
people
happy
make!


So
when
you
meet
your
friends
today,


Try
and
make
their
day!
&nbsp;
The
last
verse
is
sung
again
by
the
entire
chorus,
which
sings
and
dances
around
the
boy.
In	the
end,
the
actors
all
freeze
in
the
positions
of
the
various
characters
in
the
play.

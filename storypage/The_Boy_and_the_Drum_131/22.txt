The
robbed
man
goes
into
the
chorus,
while
the
entire
chorus
mimes
the
riding
of
the
horse
with
the
sounds.
A
drum
can
accompany
the
rhythm.
The
chorus
mimes
the
riding
on
the
spot,
while
the
boy
rides
his
horse
across
the
stage.


The
boy
was
very
happy
and
led
the
horse
along,
singing
his
song.
Boy:&nbsp;Oh
so
funny
indeed!


People
looking
for
things,


And
I
have
what
they
need!


A
man
needs
a
shirt,


But
all
he
has
is
a
big
fine
horse!


I
gave
him
my
coat,
what
did
I
get?


His
big
fine
horse,
of
course!
&nbsp;
The
"horsing"&nbsp;of
both
the
boy
and
chorus
stops.
Another
group
emerges
from
the
chorus.
These
include
the
bridegroom,
his
relatives,
and
the
drummers
of
the
party.

The
boy
went
along
humming
his
funny
song:
&nbsp;
Boy:&nbsp;Tum-ti-tee
Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee
Tot
Tum-ti-tee
Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee
Tot!


I
gave
my
bread
away
and


Look
what
I
got!


I
gave
my
bread
away
and


Got
a
lovely
pot!&nbsp;
Tum-ti-tee
Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee
Tot
Tum-ti-tee
Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee
Tot!

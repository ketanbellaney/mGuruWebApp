This
play
is
based
on
a
modern
form
of
theatre
called
Body
Theatre.
The
beauty
of
this
form
is
that
it
can
be
done
impromptu,
at
any
place,
with
as
many
or
as
few
actors
as
convenient,
with
or
without
props.
You
will
find
suggestions
on
how
to
perform
this
play
at
the
end
of
the
book.
&nbsp;
And
now
the
play!
&nbsp;The
Boy
and
the
Drum


Narrator/s&nbsp;(stepping
out
to
one
corner
of
the
stage):
A
poor
woman
had
a
son.
She
worked
hard
as
a
gardener
in
wealthy
houses
in
their
town.
They
gave
her
some
grain
in
return.
&nbsp;
One
child
mimes
the
mother,
while
other
children
form
groups
of
the
well-to-do
families.
The
mother
goes
to
each
group
and
mimes
gardening
for
these
groups.
Having
created
this
30-second
scene,
all
the
groups,
including
the
mother
freeze
in
their
positions.

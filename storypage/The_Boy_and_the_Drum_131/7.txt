Towards
the
end
of
the
song,
an
old
man
emerges
from
the
chorus.
He
mimes
trying
to
light
his
stove.
As
he
coughs,
the
entire
chorus
coughs,
thus
amplifying
the
effect
of
his
condition.



Narrator:&nbsp;And
as
he
went
skipping
along
on
his
way,
he
came
across
an
old
man.
The
old
man
was
trying
to
light
his
stove
using
some
cow-dung
cakes.
The
fire
was
not
catching
and
there
was
smoke
all
around.
The
smoke
made
the
man's
eyes
water
and
he
was
coughing.
The
little
boy
ran
up
to
him
and
said:
&nbsp;
Boy:&nbsp;What
is
the
matter
Grandpa?
Can
I
help
you
in
any
way?
&nbsp;
Old
Man:&nbsp;Ah!
Little
one,
I
am
trying
to
cook
some
food,
but
I
am
unable
to
start
a
fire.

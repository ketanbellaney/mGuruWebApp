A
man
was
shivering
in
the
cold
and
he
was
not
even
wearing
a
shirt.
He
seemed
to
be
hurt
and
was
moaning
in
pain.
The
boy
was
very
concerned
and
ran
up
to
the
man
and
said:


&nbsp;
Boy:&nbsp;You
seem
to
be
bleeding,


You
seem
to
be
hurt!
I'll
try
and
get
you
some
help.
You
also
need
a
coat.
&nbsp;
Narrator:&nbsp;The
boy
asked
the
man
how
he
came
to
be
in
such
a
sorry
state.
&nbsp;
The
man
said:
During
the
following
lines,
the
action
is
mimed.
A
group
of
actors
emerges.
They
chase
another
actor
(playing
the
man),
corner
him,
and
rob
him.

Man:
I
was
riding
my
horse
in
a
hurry.


I
was
riding
my
horse
to
the
city.

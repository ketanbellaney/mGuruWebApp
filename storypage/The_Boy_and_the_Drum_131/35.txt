From
now
on,
the
characters
will
step
out
of
the
chorus
to
the
stage
space
in
front
and
then
back
into
the
chorus
when
they
are
done
with
their
part
in
the
play.
&nbsp;
The
mother
can
wear
a
colored
dupatta,
which
she
gives
to
the
boy
when
she
gives
him
the
piece
of
wood.
All
the
other
characters
can
also
wear
dupattas,
which
they
exchange
with
the
boy
at
the
appropriate
time.
This
action
can
symbolize
sharing
and
giving,
although
this
is
not
essential
to
the
play's
action.

Narrator:
Now
the
boy
was
fascinated
with
the
sound
of
a
drum.
So
he
said:
Boy:
A
drum,
mother,
I
would
love
to
have
a
drum
to
play
with.


During
the
following
narration,
the
boy
continues
to
be
frozen
in
his
position
while
the
mother
circles
the
stage.
She
meets
one
actor
who
steps
out
of
the
chorus
as
the
merchant
to
whom
she
sells
the
grain,
another
from
whom
she
buys
flour,
and
on
the
way
she
picks
up
a
piece
of
wood,
and
goes
back
to
the
boy.

Narrator:&nbsp;The
mother
knew
she
would
never
have
enough
money
to
buy
a
drum
for
her
son.
She
went
to
the
market,
sold
her
grain
and
bought
some
gram
flour
and
some
salt.
While
returning
home,
she
felt
sad
that
she
would
have
to
face
him
empty-handed.
So
when
she
saw
a
nice
piece
of
wood
on
the
road,
she
picked
it
up
and
brought
it
home.

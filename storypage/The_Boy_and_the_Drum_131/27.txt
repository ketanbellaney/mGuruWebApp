Narrator:&nbsp;And
so
the
boy,
being
helpful
as
ever,
offered
his
horse
to
the
groom.
The
groom
was
very
happy
and
he
asked
the
boy
what
he
could
give
him
in
exchange
for
his
horse.
&nbsp;
The
boy
looked
around
among
the
musicians
and
quickly
spotted
the
drummer.
&nbsp;
He
said:
&nbsp;Boy:&nbsp;A
stitch
in
time
they
say
saves
nine.
And
what
indeed
did
save
the
day,
Was
this
splendid
horse
of
mine!


All
I
want
from
you
is


That
fine
little
drum
that
you
play!


Oh,
make
my
dreams
come
true!


Please
make
my
dream
come
true!
&nbsp;
The
drummer
steps
forward
with
his
drum,
and
hands
it
over
to
the
boy
during
the
following
lines.

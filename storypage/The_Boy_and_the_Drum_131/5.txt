The
son
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
piece
of
wood.
Yet
he
happily
carried
it
with
him
when
he
went
out
to
play.
A
happy
song
sprang
to
his
lips
and
he
went
along
singing
it:


Boy
moves
around
the
stage
while
chorus
watches
him.


Boy:&nbsp;Tum-ti-tee
Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee
Tot


Tum-ti-tee
Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee-
Tum-ti-tee
Tot!&nbsp;
I
asked
for
a
drum
and
look
what
I
got,
A
lovely
piece
of
wood!

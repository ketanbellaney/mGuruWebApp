The
boy
said:

Boy:
Dear
lady,
why
is
your
daughter
crying?


Potterâ€™s
Wife:
My
little
one
is
hungry.
She
has
not
had
anything
to
eat
since
morning.
I
cannot
give
her
anything
as
there
is
nothing
in
the
house.
I
wish
I
had
some
bread
to
give
her.



Narrator:&nbsp;The
kind
hearted
boy
gave
the
lady
his
bread.
She
gave
the
bread
to
her
child
who
ate
it
eagerly
and
stopped
crying.
She
was
so
pleased
with
the
boy
that
she
gave
him
a
large
pot.

She
broke
the
pot,
the
last
of
my
lot,

And
now
I
feel
so
sore!

I
gave
her
the
pot,
the
pot
she
broke.

The
pot
I
need
to
boil
my
clothes.

Without
the
pot,
my
clothes
will
rot.

Oh,
they
will
remain
soiled!
So
you
see,
I
have
nothing
to
boil
my
clothes
in
before
I
wash
them.
And
because
of
her,
my
trade
will
suffer.


Boy:&nbsp;Dear
Sir,
don’t
quarrel
with
your
wife.
Please
take
this
pot
of
mine
and
use
it.
&nbsp;
Narrator:&nbsp;The
washerman
was
very
happy
with
the
pot.
He
was
so
pleased
with
the
boy’s
good
nature
that
he
gave
him
a
nice
coat
in
return.
The
entire
chorus
praises
the
coat,
‘Wah,
what
a
nice
coat!
Look
at
the
colour!
Seems
very
cozy!
So
soft
and
warm!’
The
washerman
and
his
wife
make
their
way
back
to
the
chorus.

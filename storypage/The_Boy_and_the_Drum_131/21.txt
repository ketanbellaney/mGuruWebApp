A
crowd
of
thieves,
they
came
and
GOT
me!
They
got
me
down,
they
got
me
out.


They
took
my
purse,
got
all
my
money.


I
tried
to
put
up
a
good
fight.


But
they
beat
me
up,
they
beat
me
bad.


They
left
me
in
pain,
they
left
me
hurt.


They
took
it
all,
even
my
shirt!
&nbsp;
As
the
song
ends
the
acting-robber
group
goes
back
to
the
chorus.

Narrator:&nbsp;The
boy
said:
Boy:&nbsp;Your
need
is
greater
than
mine.
Please
take
this
coat.
It
will
help
you
keep
warm.
&nbsp;
Narrator:&nbsp;The
man
was
touched
by
the
little
lad's
kindness.
He
thanked
the
boy
profusely
and
presented
him
with
the
big
fine
horse
he
was
riding.

All
the
children
are
facing
away
from
the
audience
in
three
equal
lines.
A
couple
of
narrators
come
in
a
very
dramatic
fashion.
For
example,
the
two
of
them
can
be
playing
a
game
of
catch
and
suddenly
they
look
at
the
audience,
welcome
them,
and
speak
a
little
about
the
play
together
as
a
chorus:
"The
story
of
the
boy
and
the
drum,
a
story
about
sharing,
a
story
about
values,
a
story
about
people
and
not
things."
&nbsp;
The
whole
group
turns
to
the
audience
and
shouts
out
the
title
as
one
big
chorus.
The
group
stays
in
the
three
lines,
now
facing
the
audience.

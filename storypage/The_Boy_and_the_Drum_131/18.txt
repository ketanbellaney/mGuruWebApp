The
boy
ran
along
singing
his
funny
song.	


Boy:&nbsp;As
I
walked
along,
With
my
pot
in
hand,
I
met
a
washerman.
Who
gave
me
this
coat
so
grand!


Oh
so
funny
indeed!


People
looking
for
things,


And
I
have
what
they
need!
&nbsp;
Narrator:&nbsp;The
boy
walked
on,
all
the
while
admiring
his
grand
coat.
He
soon
came
to
a
bridge,
and
there
he
was
alarmed
by
what
he
saw.
&nbsp;
For
the
following
narration,
the
chorus
makes
the
sound
of
a
cold
wind
blowing.
A
man
emerges
from
the
chorus,
shivering.
He
sits
down,
curled
into
a
ball.

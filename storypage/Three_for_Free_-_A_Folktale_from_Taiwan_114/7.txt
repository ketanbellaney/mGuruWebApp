“Nonsense!”
said
the
villagers.
“Too
many
dumplings
in
your
tummy
have
made
you
think
funny!”
All
of
them
laughed
at
Eagle-Eye
Chan,
who
kept
staring
at
the
mountain
long
after
the
villagers
had
left.




That
evening,
everyone
was
talking
about
the
old
man
and
his
delicious
dumplings.
“He
must
be
a
really
stupid
man
to
give
away
three
for
free!”
they
said,
laughing.
“Let’s
hope
he
comes
every
day.”


The
next
morning,
the
old
man
arrived
again,
carrying
his
pot
of
dumplings.
He
set
the
pot
down
again
in
the
village
square.




“One
for
one
cent,
two
for
two
cents
and
three,
for
FREE!”
he
yelled.
“Peanuts
and
sesame,
and
three
for
free.”

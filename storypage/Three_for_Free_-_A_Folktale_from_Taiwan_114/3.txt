The
sweet
smell
of
fresh
dumplings
filled
the
air.



“Hot
dumplings!
Fresh,
hot
dumplings!”
he
yelled.
“One
for
one
cent,
two
for
two
cents
and
three,
for
FREE!”




Villagers
passing
by
became
curious
and
crowded
around
this
foolish
man
who
was
giving
away
dumplings
that
looked
inviting
and
smelt
absolutely
delicious.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;“One
for
one
cent,
two
for
two
cents
and
three,
for
FREE!”
yelled
the
old
man
again.
“Red
beans
and
sesame,
and
three
for
free.”




The
villagers
who
had
gathered
around
the
old
man
began
whispering
to
each
other.
“Must
be
a
trick!
Three
dumplings
for
free?
How
can
that
be?”
they
said.

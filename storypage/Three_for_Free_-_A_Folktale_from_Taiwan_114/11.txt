When
the
villagers
heard
the
young
man,
their
hearts
were
filled
with
shame.
They
hung
their
heads
in
silence.
&nbsp;
The
old
man
stepped
towards
the
young
man
and
embraced
him.
“Ha!
At
last
I’ve
found
you!”
he
cried.
“I
am
the
mountain
god
and
I
choose
you
to
be
my
pupil.
I
will
teach
you
all
the
magic
that
I
know,”
he
said,
as
tears
flowed
down
his
old,
wrinkled
face.




The
villagers
quickly
realized
that
the
mountain
god
had
disguised
himself
as
this
old
man
to
test
them.
And
to
find
a
kind-hearted
soul
who
could
become
his
pupil.



Then,
the
mountain
god
revealed
to
the
utter
shock
of
everyone
present
that
the
dumplings
they
had
been
eating
weren’t
real
dumplings.
They
were
made
from
the
mud
that
he
had
dug
out
from
the
mountain.

In
Kaohsiung
in
southern
Taiwan,
there
is
a
mountain
called
Ban
Pin
Shan,
meaning
‘one
half’.
Strange
name
for
an
ordinary
mountain,
you
might
think.
&nbsp;
But
take
one
look
at
it
and
you
will
see
why
it
is
called
so.
It
looks
like
one
half
of
the
mountain
is
missing!
Almost
as
if
someone
has
cut
off
the
top
neatly,
with
a
big
sword.
Before
you
start
to
wonder
how
it
got
its
name,
let
me
tell
you
the
legend
behind
it.
&nbsp;
Long,
long
ago,
when
Ban
Pin
Shan
was
still
a
whole
mountain,
there
used
to
be
a
village
near
it.
One
day,
a
very
old
man
came
to
the
village
carrying
a
huge
pot
on
his
head.




His
hair
was
white
as
snow,
and
so
was
his
beard.
His
face
was
wrinkled
like
the
old,
worn-out
clothes
he
wore.
He
set
the
pot
down
in
the
village
square
and
opened
the
lid.

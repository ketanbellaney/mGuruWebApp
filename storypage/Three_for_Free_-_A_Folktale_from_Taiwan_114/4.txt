“The
most
delicious
ones,
Sir,”
said
the
old
man
as
he
handed
the
first
one
to
Big-Head
Wang.




It
was
as
big
as
an
egg.
Big-Head
Wang
popped
it
into
his
mouth
and
went
mmmm….
Everyone
could
see
that
he
was
really
enjoying
the
dumpling.




By
the
time
he
finished
the
second
one,
his
stomach
was
full.
But
he
looked
at
the
old
man
and
said,
“If
I
eat
the
third
one,
I
don’t
have
to
pay.
It
is
not
a
lie,
right?”
He
wanted
to
make
sure
the
old
man
had
meant
what
he
said.


“Three
for
free
and
that
it
will
be!”
said
the
old
man,
handing
Big-Head
Wang
the
third
dumpling,
which
he
promptly
stuffed
into
his
mouth.
If
he
could
eat
it,
he
wouldn’t
have
to
pay
anything.

The
old
man
kept
his
word
and
Big-Head
Wang
went
away
happy,
his
stomach
full
to
bursting.
&nbsp;
Soon,
everyone
wanted
three
dumplings
each.
Not
a
single
villager
ordered
one
or
two
dumplings;
everyone
wanted
only
three
for
free.
In
a
while,
the
whole
pot
was
wiped
clean.
Some
of
the
villagers
were
disappointed
as
the
old
man
prepared
to
leave.
&nbsp;
“My,
my,
don’t
all
of
you
have
good
appetites,”
the
old
man
said
as
he
heaved
the
empty
pot
over
his
head
and
walked
away.




Suddenly,
Eagle-Eye
Chan,
who
had
just
gulped
down
three
free
dumplings,
cried
out,
“Look!
A
part
of
the
mountain
is
missing!”

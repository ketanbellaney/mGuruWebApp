This
time,
the
pot
was
emptied
an
hour
earlier
than
the
previous
day.
The
villagers
had
eaten
up
all
the
dumplings,
three
apiece.
And
for
free.
Quietly,
the
old
man
heaved
the
pot
over
his
head
and
left,
smiling
a
strange
smile.
&nbsp;
On
the
third
day,
the
old
man
came
again.
This
time,
the
villagers
were
waiting
for
the
stupid
old
man
to
arrive.
Soon,
they
were
trying
to
eat
as
many
dumplings
as
possible,
for
free.
&nbsp;
Suddenly,
a
voice
said,
“Mister,
can
I
have
one
dumpling,
please?”
&nbsp;
Everyone
froze!
Their
mouths
hung
open
with
bits
of
dumpling
falling
out,
as
they
tried
to
catch
sight
of
whoever
had
uttered
the
words.

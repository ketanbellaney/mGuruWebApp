As
soon
as
the
villagers
heard
this,
they
ran
to
see
the
leftover
dumplings
in
the
pot.
But
all
they
saw
was
a
pot
full
of
mud!
And
when
they
turned
to
look
at
the
mountain,
they
couldn’t
believe
their
eyes!
There
was
only
half
of
it
left
standing!
Just
as
Eagle-Eye
Chan
had
said.
But
they
had
been
too
greedy
to
listen….
&nbsp;
Soon,
the
mountain
god
took
his
young
disciple
with
him
to
the
mountain
to
teach
him
the
magic
of
the
gods.
As
for
the
villagers,
their
hearts
were
filled
with
remorse
and
they
cursed
themselves
for
being
so
greedy.
They
named
the
mountain
Ban
Pin
Sghan
–
a
name
that
stands
to
this
day
–
and
vowed
to
be
less
greedy.
&nbsp;
Now
tell
me,
if
an
old
man
came
to
your
town
selling
delicious
dumplings,
“One
for
one
cent,
two
for
two
cents
and
three,
for
FREE!”
–
how
many
would
you
buy?

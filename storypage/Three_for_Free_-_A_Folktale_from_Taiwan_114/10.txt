Now,
which
idiot
would
want
to
pay
for
ONE
dumpling
when
he
could
have
THREE
for
FREE?
There
was
pin-drop
silence.
They
saw
a
young
man
with
a
soft
face
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd,
a
single
cent
in
his
outstretched
hand.
&nbsp;
The
old
man
spoke.
“Young
man,
didn’t
you
hear
me?”
he
said.
“One
for
one
cent,
two
for
two
cents
and
three,
for
FREE!”
&nbsp;
“Yes,
I
did,”
said
the
young
man
in
a
sincere
voice.
“But
I’ve
seen
how
you’ve
carried
this
huge
pot
every
day,
giving
away
your
dumplings,
three
for
free.
&nbsp;
You
have
not
made
any
money
in
the
last
few
days
and
I
feel
sorry
for
you.
I
want
to
help,
but
I
have
only
enough
money
to
pay
for
one
dumpling.”

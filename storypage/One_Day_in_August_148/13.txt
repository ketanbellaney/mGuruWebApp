“No,
let
us
look
for
Moti
and
go
home
with
her,”
said
Shagufta.
&nbsp;
“Maybe
Moti
has
gone
there.
You
can’t
see
her
anywhere
here,
can
you?”
&nbsp;
Since
Kishen
was
adamant,
Shagufta
had
no
choice
but
to
go
along.
When
they
neared
the
crowd
of
people,
they
saw
that
they
looked
worried
and
frightened.
Most
were
balancing
awkward
bundles
on
their
heads.
Some
people
were
sobbing
and
crying
as
they
walked.
&nbsp;
Shagufta
began
to
chew
her
dupatta
again.
Somebody
asked
them
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing
alone.
&nbsp;
Shagufta
said,
“We
have
lost
our
cow.
Have
you
seen
it
anywhere?”

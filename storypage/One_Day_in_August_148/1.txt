It
was
a
hot
morning
in
August.
Not
a
leaf
stirred
anywhere,
nor
was
there
a
cloud
to
be
seen
anywhere
in
the
sky.
Kishen
was
carefully
balancing
an
upright
stick
on
one
palm
and
chewing
a
blade
of
grass
held
in
another
when
his
friend,
Shagufta,
came
running.
“Hey
Kishen!
There
is
hardly
any
grass
for
even
the
cows
and
goats
these
days,
and
here
you
are,
eating
up
their
food!”
&nbsp;
Kishen
laughed,
showing
the
big
gap
between
his
teeth.
&nbsp;
“And
if
you
keep
chewing
grass,
you
will
not
get
a
new
tooth
there,”
scolded
Shagufta.
&nbsp;
“It
is
already
starting
to
grow,”
said
Kishen
proudly
running
his
tongue
over
the
little
hard
point,
“See,
here.”
Shagufta
peered
into
his
mouth.
“Yes,
so
it
is.
But
where
is
Moti?
I
thought
you
were
with
her.”

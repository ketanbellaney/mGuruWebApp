“There
is
no
place
in
this
country
for
us
anymore,”
he
was
saying,
exactly
as
that
young
man
in
the
crowd
had.
But
Abba
said,
“Son,
this
will
always
be
our
home.”
&nbsp;
Bhai
jaan
came
out
into
the
courtyard
angrily.
Kishen
and
Shagufta
were
crouching
dismally
in
a
corner.
&nbsp;
“Bhai
jaan,
Moti
has
run
away,”
said
Shagufta
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes.




Her
elder
brother
could
never
bear
to
see
Shagufta
cry.
He
lifted
her
up
onto
his
shoulders
and
told
her
not
to
worry.
“And
why
should
it
matter
to
you
if
this
Hindu
boy’s
cow
runs
away?”
he
added
gruffly.

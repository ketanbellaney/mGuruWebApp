They
reached
the
dark
lake
but
Moti
was
nowhere
to
be
seen.
&nbsp;
“She
wandered
off
to
a
clump
of
mango
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
hillock
one
day.
She
might
have
gone
there
again,
but
there
was
scarcely
any
grass
there,”
said
Kishen
scratching
his
head.
The
two
children
ran
up
the
hillock
and
raced
down
on
the
other
side.
&nbsp;
Shagufta
came
down
faster,
but
her
kurta
got
caught
in
a
shrub
just
before
they
reached
the
end.
“I
won,
I
won,”
cried
Kishen
jumping
up
and
down
as
Shagufta
carefully
disentangled
her
kurta.
&nbsp;
“Okay,
you
won.
Where
are
your
mango
trees?
Oh,
there!”
&nbsp;
But
there
was
no
sign
of
Moti
anywhere.
Where
could
she
have
got
to?

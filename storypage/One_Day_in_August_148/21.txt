But
Shagufta
and
Kishen
were
miserable
thinking
of
people
killing
and
robbing
each
other.
Nor
could
they
stop
thinking
of
Moti.
“Do
you
think
someone
could
have
stolen
her?”
asked
Kishen.
Tears
streamed
down
his
cheeks.
“Do
you
think
they
will
kill
her?”
&nbsp;
“Don’t
say
such
things,”
said
Shagufta.
But
she
was
also
crying.
&nbsp;
It
started
growing
dark.
Kishen’s
mother
was
also
upset
about
Moti
but
she
urged
him
to
eat.
He
had
had
nothing
since
the
piece
of
pickle
in
the
morning,
but
could
still
not
bear
to
eat
anything.
Nor
could
Shagufta
eat
anything.
&nbsp;
She
kept
thinking
of
all
the
things
they
had
seen
and
heard
that
day
and
felt
sadder
and
sadder.

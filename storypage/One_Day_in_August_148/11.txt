Shagufta
and
Kishen
looked
around,
puzzled.
They
had
never
come
so
far
from
their
village
before.




Everything
was
like
their
village—
there
were
dry
fields,
some
neem
and
kikar
trees,
a
knot
of
tall
date
palms,
a
broken
scarecrow
teetering
precariously
on
a
bent
pole
and
a
thatched
hut
or
two
in
the
middle
of
distant
fields.
And
yet,
everything
was
different.
There
were
no
familiar
landmarks.
Even
as
they
looked,
they
spotted
several
people
in
the
distance
carrying
bundles.
&nbsp;
They
also
saw
a
few
bullock
carts
and
some
cows
and
buffaloes.
Kishen
was
very
curious.
&nbsp;
“Let
us
go
and
ask
them
where
they
are
off
to,”
said
Kishen,
always
looking
for
adventure.

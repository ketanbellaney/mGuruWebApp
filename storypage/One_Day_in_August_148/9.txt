“You
mean
we
have
all
become
rajas
now?”
asked
Kishen.
Maaji
had
told
him
stories
where
kings
ruled.
If
everyone
was
now
to
rule,
he
thought,
everyone
must
be
a
king.
And
he
must
also
be
a
king.




“I
will
be
a
Maharaja,”
he
said
grandly,
puffing
himself
out.
“Abba
jaan
said
the
English
will
now
leave
our
country.”
“Who
are
the
English?”
“I
don’t
know.”
Neither
of
the
children
had
ever
seen
an
Englishman.
“But
I
do
know
that
that
is
Moti,”
cried
Shagufta
suddenly
as
she
spotted
a
cow
in
the
distance.
&nbsp;
Both
of
them
ran
wildly,
shouting,
“Moti,
Moti!”
all
the
while.
But
when
they
reached
the
cow,
they
found
it
wasn’t
Moti
at
all.
It
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
and
then
shut
its
bored
eyes
again.

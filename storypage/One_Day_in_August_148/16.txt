“Muslim?
You
are
a
Muslim?
Then
what
are
you
doing
here,
children?
Where
are
your
parents?”
said
many
voices.
&nbsp;
“They
are
at
home,”
said
Kishen.
“We
are
from
Maler
Kotla.
There…”
he
pointed
with
his
finger
across
the
hillock
towards
his
village.
&nbsp;
“Well,
well,
God
knows
where
you
will
be
after
a
few
days,”
said
one
old
man
as
he
plodded
by.


Someone
in
the
crowd
wailed
loudly
and
suddenly
there
was
chaos.
Shagufta
grasped
Kishen’s
hand
and
they
ran.


When
Shagufta
reached
home,
she
heard
Bhai
jaan
telling
Abba
and
Ammi
that
they
must
leave.

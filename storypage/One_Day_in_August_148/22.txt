Just
then,
there
was
a
low
sound
of
a
cow’s
moo.
Moti!
Shagufta
rushed
out
of
her
house.
And
Kishen
had
come
out
of
his
too.
Yes,
there
was
Moti
walking
back,
dusty
and
tired.
The
children
fell
on
her
neck
and
hugged
her.
Moti
had
come
back.
Yes,
Moti
had
come
back.
Kishen’s
and
Shagufta’s
mothers
also
came
out.
&nbsp;
“Thank
god,
sister!
A
cow
is
very
valuable,”
said
Shagufta’s
mother
to
Kishen’s,
and
turned
to
Shagufta,
“Now
will
you
come
and
eat?”
&nbsp;
“Yes,
I
am
extremely
hungry,”
said
Shagufta
happily,
waving
to
Kishen
who,
too,
was
going
in
for
his
dinner.
For
the
moment,
they
forgot
that
they
had
been
sad
about
so
many,
many
things.

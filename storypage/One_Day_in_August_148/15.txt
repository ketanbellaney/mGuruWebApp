There
were
a
few
grunts
from
the
people
who
heard
them.
One
young
man
said,
“We
have
lost
everything
we
had,
little
girl,
because
your
people
have
pushed
us
out.
And
you
are
complaining
because
you
have
lost
a
cow?”
&nbsp;
“Who
pushed
whom?
I
didn’t
see
anyone
pushing,”
said
Shagufta.
&nbsp;
“Oh
yes,
they
have,
because
we
are
Muslims.
There
is
no
place
for
us
in
this
country
now,”
said
another
man
bitterly.
&nbsp;
“But
I
am
also
a
Muslim,
and
Abba
Jaan
said
this
morning
that
our
country
is
now
independent.”




Nobody
seemed
to
be
bothered
about
independence.

“So
I
was,”
said
Kishen.
He
had
come
out
as
usual
to
graze
his
cow
and
had
as
usual
become
engrossed
in
his
games
and
forgotten
to
keep
an
eye
on
her.
Fortunately
Moti
never
went
very
far
and
he
had
never
yet
lost
her.
“Let’s
go
look
for
her,”
said
Shagufta.
She
was
a
very
responsible
eight
year
old.
&nbsp;
“I
know
the
places
she
likes
best,”
said
Kishen.
“There
is
a
thicket
near
the
pond
with
the
water
hyacinths.
I
have
warned
her
that
there
must
be
crocodiles
hidden
under
the
flowers
but
she
keeps
going
off
to
the
same
place.”
He
began
running.
“There
are
no
crocodiles
here,
silly,”
said
Shagufta.
&nbsp;
“But
I
have
seen
water
snakes
in
the
pond.
That
is
why
no
one
goes
there
to
bathe.”
Shagufta
was
a
year
older
than
Kishen
and
knew
a
great
many
more
things
than
he
did.

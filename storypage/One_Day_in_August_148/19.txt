Kishen’s
grandmother
picking
up
dried
dung
cakes
in
her
yard
heard
Bhai
jaan.
&nbsp;
“Listen
Javed,
my
son!”
she
said.
&nbsp;
“Long
long
ago,
when
Guru
Gobind
Singh
ji
was
fleeing
from
his
pursuers,
the
Nawab
of
Maler
Kotla
gave
him
shelter.
And
Guru
Gobind
Singh
ji
blessed
our
village
saying
that
whatever
happened
in
the
land,
the
people
of
Maler
Kotla
would
always
give
shelter
to
one
another.
I
know
that
people
are
killing
and
robbing
everywhere.
Times
are
bad,
very
bad.
But
believe
me,
son,
in
our
village,
we
will
all
remain
brothers
and
sisters.”
&nbsp;
Bhai
jaan’s
anger
melted
away.
He
put
Shagufta
down,
patted
her
and
told
her
to
go
and
play
with
Kishen.

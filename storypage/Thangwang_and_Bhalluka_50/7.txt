What
Do
We
Know
About
Bears?

&nbsp;


In
India,
there
are
three
kinds
of
bears
-
The
Himalayan
Black
Bear,
The
Brown
Bear
and
The
Sloth
Bear.
The
bear
in
this
book
looks
like
a
brown
bear.
&nbsp;
Bears
like
fresh
growing
shoots
of
grass.
They
also
like
fruits
like
apples,
peaches
and
mulberries.
Though
brown
bears
do
kill
goats
and
other
animals,
they
usually
do
not
attack
human
beings.
&nbsp;
During
winter
in
cold
places,
bears
in
the
wild
do
not
get
enough
to
eat.
What
do
they
do
then?
They
just
go
to
sleep
for
a
very
long
time!
This
long
sleep
is
called
hibernation.
They
can
sleep
without
eating,
drinking
or
-
even
going
to
the
bathroom
-
for
more
than
100
days!

#6FrameStoryChallenge:
A
Carnival
of
Art


The
illustrations
in
this
book
were
created
as
part
of
the
#6FrameStoryChallenge,
an
online
campaign
run
by
Pratham
Books
to
build
a
rich
bank
of
illustrations
for
StoryWeaver.
The
essence
of
the
#6FrameStoryChallenge
was
to
tell
a
good
story
using
just
6
illustrations.




The
campaign
inspired
nearly
70
illustrators
to
donate
their
time
and
skills
to
India’s
first
open-source
story-publishing
platform
for
children.
What
started
out
as
an
experimental
campaign
soon
blossomed
into
a
carnival
of
art,
birthing
nearly
500
new
illustrations.




These
wordless
narratives
cut
across
language
barriers,
opening
up
a
world
of
possibilities,
encouraging
StoryWeaver’s
growing
community
to
dream
up
multiple
stories
around
these
images.
The
#6FrameStoryChallenge
is
a
powerful
reminder
of
the
need
for
collaboration,
to
get
closer
to
our
mission:
“A
Book
in
Every
Child’s
Hand.”

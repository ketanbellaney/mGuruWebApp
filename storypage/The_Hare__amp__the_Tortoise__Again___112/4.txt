Many
months
passed.
The
king
of
the
jungle
where
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
lived
had
some
important
matters
to
discuss
with
the
king
of
the
neighbouring
jungle.
But
the
first
king
could
not
leave
his
jungle
just
then.
He
decided,
instead,
to
send
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
to
the
neighbouring
king,
as
his
representatives.

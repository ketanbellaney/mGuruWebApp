Why&nbsp;
does&nbsp;
this&nbsp;
happen?

When
you
add
the
first
few
drops
of
milk
to
the
water,
the
number
of
molecules
in
the
water
increases.
The
fat
and
protein
molecules
in
the
milk
scatter
the
light
so
that
we
can
see
it.
When
you
increase
the
number
of
molecules
by
adding
more
milk,
the
light
is
scattered
more,
especially
the
blue
light,
which
has
a
shorter
wavelength.

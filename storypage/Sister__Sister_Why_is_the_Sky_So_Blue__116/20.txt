Try
this
experiment!
&nbsp;
Why
does
the
sky
appear
orange
and
red
at
dawn
and
dusk?
Let's
try
this
exercise
to
find
out.
&nbsp;
You&nbsp;
need:
A
clear
glass
full
of
water
A
little
milk
A
torch
&nbsp;
What&nbsp;
to&nbsp;
do:
Shine
the
torch
on
the
glass
of
water.
Can
you
see
the
light
in
the
water?
Hardly.
Now
add
a
few
drops
of
milk
into
the
water.
Then
shine
the
torch
again
on
the
glass.
This
time,
you
will
notice
that
the
light
is
more
visible.
Add
a
few
more
drops
of
milk.
Now
you
will
notice
that
the
light
in
the
glass
is
distinctly
blue.

Oh
yes,
you
are,
little
brother,&nbsp;
oh
yes
you
areAnd
maybe
you
are
right,
too…
But
in
the
books
I
have
read
That
is
not
what
they
said.
Then
what
did
they
say,
sister,
What
did
they
say?
What
do
you
think,
little
brother,
What
do
you
think?
They
said,
they
said…
Tell
me,
sister,
what
did
they
say?

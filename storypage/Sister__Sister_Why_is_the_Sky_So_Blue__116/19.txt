Why&nbsp;
is&nbsp;
the&nbsp;
sky&nbsp;
blue?
&nbsp;
Sunlight
is
made
up
of
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow:
red,
orange,
yellow,
green,
blue,
indigo
and
violet.
The
gas
molecules
in
the
atmosphere
interact
with
the
sunlight
before
it
reaches
our
eyes.
Each
‘colour’
of
light
is
actually
a
different
wavelength
of
electromagnetic
radiation.
Different
wavelengths
not
only
make
up
different
colours,
they
also
behave
differently.
Each
of
the
different
wavelengths
in
sunlight
(or,
in
other
words,
each
of
the
colours
that
sunlight
is
made
up
of)
interacts
differently
with
the
molecules
in
the
atmosphere.
When
sunlight
strikes
the
molecules,
they
scatter
the
blue
light
(which
has
a
shorter
wavelength)
more
than
they
do
the
red,
orange,
yellow
and
green
lights
(which
have
longer
wavelengths).
Since
the
blue
portion
is
scattered
more,
the
sky
appears
blue.

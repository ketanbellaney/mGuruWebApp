Sniffles
did
not
want
to
be
a
crocodile.
'I
am
so
ugly,'
he
thought,
bursting
into
tears.
He
did
not
even
want
to
live
like
crocodiles
do.
His
best
friend
was
Punch,
a
golden
yellow
butterfly.
And
Punch
wanted
to
be
big
and
strong.
So
Punch
always
had
her
feeler
curled
into
a
fist
saying,
“Look
out!
I
will
punch
you
in
the
mouth.”

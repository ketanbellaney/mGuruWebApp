The
other
crocodiles
heard
Sniffles
crying
and
shouting,
“Men
coming
to
kill
us.
Hide
...
Hurry
...
Hide.”
At
first
the
crocodiles
did
not
believe
Sniffles,
but
then
they
heard
the
men’s
footsteps.
&nbsp;
The
crocodiles
went
deep
into
the
river
and
left
some
rotten
logs
floating
on
the
water.
The
men
shot
at
the
logs
which
looked
like
crocodiles
from
afar.
The
men
could
not
see
any
crocodiles,
only
hundreds
of
butterflies
that
flew
into
their
faces
and
hair.

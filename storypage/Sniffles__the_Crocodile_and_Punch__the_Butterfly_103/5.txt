One
sunny
afternoon,
Punch
settled
herself
near
Sniffles’
ear
and
told
him,
“I
have
seen
two
men
come
this
way
with
guns,
they
want
to
kill
crocodiles
for
their
skins.”
“Don’t
these
men
have
skins
of
their
own?”
asked
a
puzzled
Sniffles.
“I
don’t
know
Sniffles,”
replied
Punch.
“Tell
the
other
crocodiles
and
hide.”

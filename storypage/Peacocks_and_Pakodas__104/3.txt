Aunty
likes
to
sing
aloud
when
it
starts
raining.
Shubha
aunty
who
lives
in
Varanasi,
taught
me
some
lovely
songs
called
‘Kajari’.


Do
you
know,
Miyan
Tansen,
a
very
famous
singer
in
the
court
of
Emperor
Akbar,
could
bring
the
rain
down
from
the
skies
just
by
singing
a
song
in
raag
‘Miyan
ki
Malhar!'
I
am
going
to
start
learning
Indian
classical
music
too.

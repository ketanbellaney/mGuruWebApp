All
the
trees
and
plants
will
look
green
and
happy.
Just
like
the
green
dupatta
that
Hari
bhaiya
sent
for
me
from
Jaipur.
He
said
it
is
called
a
‘dhaani
chunariya.’


‘Dhaani’
means
the
fresh
green
colour
of
paddy
saplings.
Grandpa
told
me
that
good
rain
means
the
farmers
will
get
a
good
crop.
We
all
wait
for
the
rains,
but
farmers
worship
the
rain
gods.

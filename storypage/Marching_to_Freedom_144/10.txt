“I’m
nine
and
I
can
run
faster
than
you
can!”

Dhani
replied
stubbornly.
“You
can’t
stop
me

from
coming
with
you.”


His
father
stopped
spinning
and
explained

patiently,
“Only
the
people
who
have
been

chosen
by
Mahatmaji
will
go.”

“Fine!
I’ll
talk
to
him
then!
I’m
sure
he’ll
say
yes,”
said
Dhani
and
marched
off.


Gandhiji
was
a
very
busy
man
and
it
was
not
easy
to
catch
him
alone.
But
Dhani
knew
exactly
when
he
would
have
the
time
to
listen
–
early
every
morning
when
he
went
for
a
walk
around
the
ashram.


The
next
morning,
as
the
sun
came
up,
Dhani
slipped
out
of
bed
and
went
looking
for
Gandhiji.
He
found
him
in
the
cowshed
checking
on
all
the
cows.
Then
he
strolled
into
the
vegetable
garden
to
inspect
the
peas
and
cabbage
and
have
a
chat
with
Binda.

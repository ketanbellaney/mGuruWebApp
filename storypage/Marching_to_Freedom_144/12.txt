All
the
while,
Dhani
and
Binni
followed
him.


Finally,
Gandhiji
headed
back
to
his
hut.
He
sat
down
beside
his
charkha
in
the
verandah
and
called
out
to
Dhani,
“Come
here,
child!”
Dhani
ran
up,
with
Binni
skipping
along.


“What’s
your
name
beta?”


“Dhani,
Gandhiji.”


“And
this
is
your
goat?”


“Yes,
Gandhiji!
This
is
my
friend
Binni,
who
gives
the
milk
you
drink
every
morning.”
Dhani
smiled
proudly
and
said,
“I
take
care
of
her.”

“Good!”
Gandhiji
leaned
forward.
“Now
Dhani,
tell
me
why
you
and
Binni
have
been
following

me
everywhere
this
morning?”

“Hmm,
you’re
right,
Gandhiji.
Binni
eats
only
when
I
feed
her.”
Dhani
lovingly
stroked
Binni’s
head,
“And
only
I
know
what
she
likes
to
eat.”
&nbsp;
“Exactly!
So
will
you
stay
in
the
ashram
and
take
care
of
Binni
for
me?”
“
Yes,
Gandhiji,
I
will,”
said
Dhani.
“And
Binni
and
I
will
be
waiting
for
you.”

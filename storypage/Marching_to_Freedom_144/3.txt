That
morning,
as
Dhani
fed
Binni
with
fresh
grass
and
changed
the
water
in
her
bowl,
he
said,
“Something’s
up,
Binni!
They
all
sit
and
talk
in
Gandhiji’s
room.
They
are
planning
something.
I
know
it!”
&nbsp;
Binni
chewed
and
nodded
as
if
she
understood.
Dhani
felt
hungry.
He
headed
towards
the
kitchen,
with
Binni
skipping
along
beside
him.
His
mother
was
fanning
the
chulha,
filling
up
the
room
with
smoke.
&nbsp;
“Amma,
is
Gandhiji
going
somewhere?”
he
asked.
His
mother
coughed
in
the
smoke
and
said,
“They
are
going
on
a
march.”
“March?
Where
are
they
going?”
Dhani
queried.
&nbsp;
“Somewhere
near
the
sea.
Now
stop
asking
questions
and
go
away
Dhani!”
his
mother
said
impatiently.
“Let
me
finish
the
cooking
first.”


Dhani
wandered
off
to
the
vegetable
garden
where
old
Binda
was
digging
up
potatoes.

Later
in
the
morning,
Dhani
wandered
up
to
the
hut
where
Gandhiji
was
staying
and
peered
in
through
a
window.
Inside,
many
of
the
ashram
people
were
talking
to
Gandhiji.
Dhani
heard
them
planning
the
route
along
which
they
would
walk
to
Dandi.
He
was
thrilled
to
see
his
father
sitting
among
the
people.

In
the
afternoon,
when
the
ashram
was
quiet,

Dhani
went
looking
for
his
father.
He
found

him
under
a
tree,
spinning
on
his
charkha.


“Pitaji,
are
you
and
Amma
going
on
the
march
to
Dandi?”
Dhani
got
straight
to
the

&nbsp;
point.


“I
am
going.
You
and
Amma
will
stay
here.”


“I
am
coming
with
you.”


“Don’t
be
silly,
Dhani.
You
can’t
walk
so
much.

Only
the
ashram’s
young
men
will
go.”

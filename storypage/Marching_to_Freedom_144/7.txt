“Of
course
it’s
unfair.
Not
only
that,
Indians
are
not
allowed
to
make
any
salt
either.
Mahatmaji
has
asked
the
British
to
stop
the
tax,
but
they
have
refused.
So
he
has
decided
to
walk
to
Dandi
and
make
salt
from
seawater.”
&nbsp;
“Walking
for
a
month!”
Dhani
brooded
worriedly.
“Gandhiji
will
get
really
tired.
Why
don’t
they
take
a
bus
or
train
to
Dandi
instead?”


“Because,
if
he
goes
on
this
long
march
and
walks
all
the
way
to
Dandi,
the
news
will
spread.
There
will
be
pictures
in
the
papers
and
reports
on
the
radio,
and
people
all
over
the
world
will
know
that
we
are
fighting
for
our
freedom.
And
that
will
really
embarrass
the
British.”
&nbsp;
“Gandhiji
is
clever,
isn’t
he?”
Dhani’s
eyes
were
shining.
“Ah,
that
he
is!”
Binda’s
eyes
crinkled
with
laughter.
“He’s
even
written
to
the
Viceroy
and
told
him
what
he
plans
to
do!
The
British
have
no
idea
what
they
are
in
for!”

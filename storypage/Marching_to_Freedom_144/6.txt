“Salt?”
Dhani
sat
up
and
frowned.
“Why
will
they
make
salt?
You
can
buy
it
in
every
shop!”


“I
know,”
Binda
laughed.
“But
Mahatmaji
has
a
plan.
You
know
he
always
marches
to
protest
against
something,
right?”


“Of
course
I
know.
He
leads
the
Satyagraha
marches
to
fight
the
British
government
and
win
freedom
for
India.
But
why
is
he
protesting
about
salt?
It’s
silly!”

“It’s
not
silly
at
all,
Dhani!
Do
you
know
we
all
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
salt?”


“So
what?”


“Everyone
needs
salt...
that
means,
every
Indian,
even
the
poorest,
has
to
pay
this
tax,”
explained
Binda
chacha.

“That
is
really
unfair!”
Dhani’s
eyes
were
hot
with
anger.

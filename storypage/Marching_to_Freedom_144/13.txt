“I
wanted
to
ask
you
something,”
Dhani
began

nervously.
“Can
I
come
with
you
to
Dandi?”


Gandhiji
smiled,
“You
are
too
small,
beta.&nbsp;
Dandi

is
385
kilometres
away
and
only
young
men
like
your
father
will
be
able
to
walk
with
me.”


“But
you
are
not
young!”
Dhani
said.
“Won’t
you
feel
tired?”

&nbsp;
“I
am
a
very
good
walker,”
Gandhiji
replied.


“I
am
a
good
walker
too.”
Dhani
was
adamant.


“Ah
yes,”
Gandhiji
looked
thoughtful.
“But
there
is
a
problem.
If
you
go
with
me,
who
will
take
care
of
Binni?
After
walking
for
so
long,
I
will
become
weak.
When
I
come
back,
I’ll
need
to
drink
lots
of
milk
to
become
strong
again.”

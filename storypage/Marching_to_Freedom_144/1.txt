Dhani
knew
something
exciting
was
being
planned
at
the
ashram,
but
no
one
would
tell
him
anything.
“Just
because
I’m
nine
years
old,”
thought
Dhani
glumly.
“I’m
sure
they
think
I’m
stupid.
I
am
not!”
&nbsp;
Dhani
and
his
parents
lived
in
a
very
special
place.
It
was
Mahatma
Gandhi’s
Sabarmati
Ashram
near
Ahmedabad
where
people
from
all
over
India
came
to
stay.
Like
Gandhiji,
they
were
all
fighting
for
India’s
freedom.
During
their
stay
at
the
ashram,
they
spent
their
time
spinning
khadi
thread
on
charkhas,
singing
bhajans
and
listening
to
Gandhiji’s
lectures.
&nbsp;
At
Sabarmati,
everyone
had
to
work
–
cook
and
clean,
wash
clothes,
fetch
water
from
the
well,
milk
the
cows
and
goats,
and
grow
vegetables.
Even
Dhani
had
a
job
–
he
had
to
take
care
of
Binni,
one
of
the
ashram’s
goats.
He
quite
enjoyed
that
because
Binni
was
his
best
friend
and
he
liked
talking
to
her.

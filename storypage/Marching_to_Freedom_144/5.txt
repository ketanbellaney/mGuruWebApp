“Binda
chacha,”
Dhani
sat
beside
him,
“are
you
going
on
the
march
too?”
&nbsp;
Binda
shook
his
head.
Before
he
could
say
anything,
Dhani
eagerly
asked,
“Who
is
marching?
Where
are
they
going?
What
is
happening?”




Binda
stopped
digging
and
said,
“I’ll
answer
all
your
questions,
but
first
tie
up
that
troublesome
goat.
She’s
chewing
up
my
spinach.”
&nbsp;
Dhani
dragged
Binni
away
and
tied
her
to
the
lemon
tree
nearby.
Then
Binda
told
him
about
the
march.
Gandhiji
and
some
of
the
men
from
the
ashram
were
going
to
walk
through
Gujarat
to
reach
the
sea
at
a
place
called
Dandi.
They
would
walk
through
villages
and
towns
for
a
whole
month.
Once
they
reached
Dandi,
they
would
make
salt.

One
day,
Shanti
came
into
the
classroom
slowly.
Her
head
was
bent.
She
looked
sad.
“Did
someone
scold
you?”
asked
Arun.
Shanti
shook
her
head.
She
sat
down
and
did
not
look
up.
She
did
not
answer
‘Present!’
when
Sona
Miss
called
her
name.
Sona
Miss
called
again,
louder
this
time,
“Shanti
Kumar!”
Shanti
raised
her
hand.

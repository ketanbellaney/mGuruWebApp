“Is
it?
I
didn’t
think
of
the
outcome
when
I
threw
the
bag
outside.
I
have
seen
everyone
do
it,
so
I
do
it
out
of
habit
now.”
explained
the
lady.

“Now
you
know
better,
no?
So
next
time
please
wait
till
the
platform
comes?
There
are
dustbins
there!”
I
said.

“Okay,
I
will
listen
to
you
young
lady.
We
must
change
with
the
times.”
said
the
aunty.

We
both
exchanged
really
wide
smiles
and
I
felt
really
proud
of
myself.

I
was
shaken
out
of
my
thoughts
when
I
heard
the
voice
of
the
announcer
announcing
that
the
next
destination
was
my
station.

I
dusted
my
outfit
a
little
and
got
up.

The
Lantern
Queen
now
had
to
face
her
mother.
This
I
knew
was
going
to
be
a
tough
one.

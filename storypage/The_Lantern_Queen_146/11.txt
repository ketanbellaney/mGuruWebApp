This
was
depressing.
There
had
to
be
a
way
out.

“Purvi,
will
you
please
come
here?”
called
out
my
editor.

Like
an
obedient
zombie,
I
got
up
and
walked
towards
her
desk.

“You
know
we
are
coming
up
with
our
Diwali
Special
issue,
right?”
she
asked

“Yes
ma’am.”
I
replied.

“So
here
is
something
that
is
going
to
make
your
day
brighter.
You
have
to
come
up
with
a
fictional
character
and
its
story.
We
will
carry
this
as
a
continuing
series
in
the
magazine
till
Diwali.
This
character
has
to
talk
about
the
festivities
that
are
seen
in
the
city
right
before
the
actual
festival.
Like
a
build-up,
you
know?”

My
mind
was
racing
now.
“Yes,
I
get
it.”

“This
is
quite
a
big
opportunity
for
an
intern,
Purvi.
You
are
getting
it
because
the
rest
of
the
team
has
their
hands
full
already.
And
if
you
get
this
right,
we
might
consider
you
for
a
permanent
employee
too.”
said
my
editor.

“Ma’am,
umm,
uh,
err.
Can
this
character
be
called
the
Lantern
Queen?”
I
asked
with
all
hope.

My
editor
fell
silent
for
a
few
seconds.
I
could
feel
my
heart
beat
pick
up.
I
was
sure
it
was
audible
to
everyone
else
too
now.

“Lantern
Queen?”
she
asked,

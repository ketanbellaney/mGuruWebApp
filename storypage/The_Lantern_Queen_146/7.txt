After
a
quick
auto
ride
from
station
to
home,
I
found
myself
standing
outside
the
door
of
my
house.

I
was
a
little
worried
now.
My
clothes
were
costly.
I
didn’t
want
to
be
greeted
by
an
angry
mother.

So
again,
I
forced
myself
to
think
like
the
Lantern
Queen.
And
the
bulb
in
my
head
did
flicker,
but
it
came
right
on.

I
quickly
rummaged
my
bag
for
the
house
key.
I
knew
I
had
it
in
there
somewhere.
Soon
enough,
I
found
it.

I
opened
the
door
and
ran
into
my
room.
“Hi
Maa!
I’m
home,”
I
yelled
as
I
crossed
my
parent’s
room.

By
the
time
my
mom
came
to
see
what
was
up,
I
was
safely
inside
my
bathroom.

“What
are
you
doing
inside?”
enquired
a
suspicious
mother.

“Ma!
I
am
taking
a
bath!”
I
yelled.

“Why?”
continued
the
suspicious
mother.

“Because
I
feel
like
it
Ma!
I’m
all
sweaty.”

“Okay.
I
will
see
you
at
the
dinner
table.
Be
quick.”
she
ended.

I
knew
well
that
she
was
not
convinced.
Mothers
have
this
instinct.
They
just
know
everything.

But
this
time
I
had
escaped
because
I
was
the
Lantern
Queen.
I
washed
my
clothes
squeaky
clean
and
realised
that
a
mistake
is
not
really
a
mistake
if
one
can
undo
it.

When
I
came
out,
mom
was
at
the
table.

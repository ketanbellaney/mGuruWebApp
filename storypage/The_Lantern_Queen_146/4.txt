I
was
carefully
looking
left
to
cross
the
road
when
a
cabbie
came
by
in
full
speed
and
splashed
a
whole
lot
of
muck
over
my
jeans.

If
this
were
yet
another
day,
I
would
have
started
running
behind
the
cabbie
while
showering
him
with
all
the
curse
words
I
knew
of.

But
today,
I
kept
my
cool.
I
let
him
go
and
thought,
why
did
this
happen?

This
time,
the
bulb
in
my
head
didn’t
go
on.
So,
I
did
the
most
fun
thing
I
could
do
in
that
moment.
I
walked
right
into
that
puddle
of
muck
and
jumped
up
and
down
till
my
whole
top
was
dirty
as
well.

By
the
time
I
was
out,
I
saw
a
million
eyes
staring
at
me.
But,
I
didn’t
feel
embarrassed.
I
was
now
the
Lantern
Queen,
and
they
didn’t
know
that
the
Lantern
Queen
could
do
anything.

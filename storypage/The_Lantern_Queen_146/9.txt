When
I
felt
the
warmth
of
the
sun
on
my
face,
I
knew
it
was
morning.

I
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
that
I
was
up
much
before
the
alarm.

This
came
as
a
pleasant
surprise.

I
felt
like
a
true
queen
in
her
chamber.
I
got
off
the
bed
with
great
grace
and
poise.

I
decided
I
will
wear
the
royal
purple
and
picked
out
my
clothes
from
the
wardrobe.

In
no
time,
I
was
ready.

I
went
to
my
parent’s
room
to
find
both
of
them
happily
chatting
away
over
a
cup
of
tea.

“Good
morning
from
the
queen!”
I
announced
before
I
walked
in.

“But
aren’t
you
our
princess?”
asked
dad
puzzled.

“Dad,
I
am
multitasking!”
I
replied.

“Ahh,
ok
your
highness.”
replied
dad.

With
dad,
it
was
always
like
this.
No
questions
asked.
Just
go
with
the
flow.

I
had
a
quick
cup
of
tea
with
them
discussed
the
beautiful
weather.
As
soon
I
was
done
with
my
cup,
I
took
off
for
work.

The
Lantern
Queen
was
never
late,
I
knew
that.

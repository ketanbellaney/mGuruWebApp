I
knew
being
the
Lantern
Queen
was
not
going
to
be
easy.
I
had
to
open
up
my
mind
and
think
profound
thoughts.
I
had
to
let
the
light
come
in.

As
I
walked
to
the
station,
I
saw
a
lady
running
behind
a
taxi.
This
was
a
rather
common
site
in
the
mad
Mumbai
city.

But
today,
I
pushed
myself
to
look
beyond
the
obvious
and
find
the
real
meaning
hidden
behind
this
scene.
What
am
I
missing?
There
had
to
be
something,
I
thought.

Think
like
the
Lantern
Queen!
I
told
myself.

Then,
out
of
nowhere,
it
came
to
me.
I
figured
that
running
behind
anything
in
life
was
a
complete
waste
of
energy.
Running
behind
marks
as
a
student,
behind
money
as
an
adult,
was
all
futile.

So,
I
took
a
conscious
call.
If
the
thing
I
want
can
walk
with
me
at
my
pace,
then
it’s
going
to
be
worth
the
effort.
If
I
have
to
keep
running
behind
something,
then
it
is
simply
not
going
to
be
sustainable.
For
how
long
will
I
keep
running?

And
anyways,
I
didn’t
enjoy
running
much.

After
this
great
analysis,
I
felt
really
enlightened.
I
had
opened
up
my
mind
and
this
role-play
was
now
becoming
really
interesting.

So
with
a
spring
in
my
step,
I
marched
on
towards
the
station.

I
parked
myself
right
under
the
big
orange
lantern
and
asked,
“Do
I
look
like
a
Lantern
Queen?”

I
waited
for
exactly
three
minutes.
To
my
dismay,
no
one
replied.

Rajjo
was
really
busy
in
a
deep
conversation.
“Rajjo,
Rajjo,
Rajjo,
Rajjo!”
I
yelled.

She
finally
tore
away
from
the
deep
discussion
and
looked
at
me.

“Do
I
look
like
a
lantern
queen?”
I
asked,
again.

“You're
mad.”
said
Rajjo.
She
looked
away
and
promptly
got
back
to
her
seemingly
important
discussion.

I
now
turned
to
Shriya.
Surprisingly
she
was
already
staring
at
me.
“Can
you
see
how
I'm
letting
that
question
just
pass?”
she
said
with
her
sharp
eyebrow
raised.

Sigh!
The
life
of
a
Lantern
Queen
is
going
to
be
difficult;
I
thought
and
looked
at
Shruti.

Shruti
was
also
already
staring
at
me.
But
she
had
an
I-am-observing-you
look
all
over
her
face.
After
a
close
examination
she
finally
said,
“You
look
more
like
you
have
a
jelly
fish
on
your
head.”

“So,
I’m
the
Jelly
Fish
Queen?”
I
asked.

“Not
a
queen
really…”
said
Shruti.

“So
a
layperson
with
a
jelly
fish
on
the
head?”
I
confirmed.

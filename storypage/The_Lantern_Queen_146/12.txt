“Hmm.
Okay,
that
does
have
a
ring
to
it.
Quickly
write
your
character
sketch
and
treatment
and
send
it
across
to
me.
Let’s
get
this
working.”
she
concluded.

What!
Did
I
just
hear
that
right?
This
had
to
be
the
best
day
of
my
life!

It
was
right
then
I
realised
that,
by
appearing
above
my
head
the
previous
day,
the
lantern
had
changed
something.
Its
light
had
touched
me
and
transformed
me
for
life.
It
had
ensured
that
I
could
not
only
be
the
Lantern
Queen
forever,
but
also
write
about
it
publically!

Somewhere
deep
down
inside,
I
just
knew
this
was
my
very
own
big
break.

This
Diwali
was
going
to
be
full
of
lights,
laughter
and
happiness.


The
End

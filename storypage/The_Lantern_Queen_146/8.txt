She
had
made
hot
soup
with
fried
bread.

I
was
so
hungry
that
I
gulped
down
two
bowl-fulls.

By
the
end
of
it
all,
my
full
stomach
was
making
me
really
drowsy.

“Can
I
go
to
sleep,
ma?”
I
asked
her.

“Are
you
sure
everything
is
fine?
Don’t
you
want
to
share
some
office
gossip
today?”
she
asked.

“Yes
ma!
All
is
fine!
I
promise.
I’m
just
sleepy.”
I
said.

“Fine,
go
to
sleep.
But
you
have
to
catch-up
with
me
tomorrow.”
she
said
before
I
pecked
her
on
the
cheek
and
headed
straight
to
bed.

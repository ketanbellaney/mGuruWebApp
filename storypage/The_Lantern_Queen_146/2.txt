“Yes.”
she
said.

“Oh!
Okay.”
I
said
and
sat
down.


What
does
Shruti
know
about
the
Lantern
Queen,
I
thought.

They
are
all
jealous.
They
don’t
want
to
acknowledge
the
fact
that
I
am
now
the
Lantern
Queen.

It
had
to
be!
It
is
not
every
day
that
a
huge
lantern
appears
right
about
your
head.

It
had
to
mean
something.
And
I
knew
exactly
what
it
meant.
Only
these
guys
were
being
oblivious
to
the
facts.

I
decided
that
I
had
to
leave
for
the
day.
I
now
had
the
responsibility
of
being
the
Lantern
Queen.

I
looked
at
my
watch
and
saw
it
was
almost
6.00
in
the
evening.
So
I
started
packing
up.

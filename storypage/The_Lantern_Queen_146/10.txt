My
journey
to
work
went
as
smooth
as
my
morning.
It
flowed
like
a
calm
stream
of
the
river.
No
jerks,
no
breaks,
no
peaks,
no
falls.
No
extremes.

I
reached
office
a
little
before
time.
I
punched-in
and
walked
towards
my
team.
With
an
air
of
superiority,
I
went
and
sat
at
my
desk.

I
put
on
the
computer
and
looked
up
at
my
lantern.

What
I
saw
now,
shook
me.

The
lantern
was
gone!
It
was
gone?

I
didn’t
understand
the
meaning
of
this.
I
stood
up
to
see
where
it
had
moved.

I
stared
at
the
receptionist
with
great
anger.
My
lantern
was
right
above
her
head.

“Who
did
that?”
I
asked
Shruti,
pointing
towards
the
lantern.


“Must
be
of
office
boys.
They
are
the
ones
in
charge
of
the
Diwali
decorations,
no?
They
must
have
moved
it.”

“But,
it
was
right
above
my
head
yesterday!”
I
complained.

“Yes,
but
now
it
is
above
the
reception
desk
where
everyone
can
see
it
and
feel
the
Diwali
feel!”
said
Shruti
putting
some
sense
in
the
discussion.

I
turned
away
from
her
and
sat
down.

This
was
very
upsetting.
Was
I
the
Lantern
Queen
just
for
a
day?
I
didn’t
want
to
stop
being
the
Lantern
Queen.
I
was
enjoying
each
and
every
minute
of
it.

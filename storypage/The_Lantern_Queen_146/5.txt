I
picked
up
my
pace
once
again
and
walked
towards
the
station.

Once
I
got
onto
my
platform,
I
saw
the
most
miraculous
sight.
Slowly
pulling
in
was
a
12-coach
train
that
was
completely
empty!

For
a
city
dweller,
this
situation
is
worthy
of
great
emotions.
I
could
feel
a
surge
of
emotions
swell
in
me.
I
was
elated
beyond
words.

I
promptly
stepped
into
the
train
and
made
myself
comfortable
for
the
ride
back
home.


Train
journeys
back
home
were
my
most
favourite
part
of
the
day.
I
could
feel
the
stress
release
my
system.
This
was
also
my
thinking
time.

And
so,
I
put
my
thinking
cap
on.

I
pondered
on
what
would
the
Lantern
Queen
do
in
this
valuable
free
time?

I
didn’t
have
to
think
too
long,
as
a
fellow
passenger
soon
gave
me
the
answer
by
throwing
a
bag
full
of
garbage
out
of
the
window.

I
gently
got
up
and
sat
next
to
that
lady
and
told
her,
“Aunty,
please
don’t
throw
things
out
of
the
window.”

“Why
not?”
she
asked
almost
confused.

“Cause
it
can
result
in
the
spread
of
many
diseases,
aunty!
If
you
have
thrown
some
kind
of
food,
then
it
will
encourage
the
rodents
and
rats
on
the
tracks.
It
is
not
at
all
hygienic.”
I
said.

Main
hoooon
Ramjiii
kaaa
chelaaa…
“He’s
SINGING?”
Saru’s
eyes
were
wide
with
shock.
Main
hoon…
Hanumaaan…
albelaaa…
Hanuman
sang
on…
&nbsp;
“He’s
good!”
Kallu
was
laughing
in
delight.
“Badri
Bhaiya
can
really
sing.”
&nbsp;
In
the
wings,
Masterji
was
standing
absolutely
still,
as
if
struck
by
lightning.
He
was
staring
at
his
star
actor
as
Badri
sang
away,
and
in
shock
he
had
forgotten
to
chew
his
paan.


Badri
sang,
eyes
raised
to
the
roof
and
one
arm
raised
like
a
filmi
hero.
His
tune
had
a
nice
rhythm,
and
the
audience
began
to
clap,
and
even
Narain
forgot
he
was
on
stage
and
joined
in.

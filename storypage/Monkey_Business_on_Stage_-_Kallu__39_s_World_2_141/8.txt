According
to
Kallu
and
his
gang,
the
scene
where
Hanuman
exchanges
insults
with
Ravan
and
then
sets
Lanka
on
fire
was
an
absolute
super-hit
scene.
Masterji
had
written
such
fantastic
dialogues
for
Ravan
and
Hanuman
that
the
audience
was
totally
hypnotized
and
listened
to
every
word
in
breathless
silence.
&nbsp;
That
evening,
the
gang
was
among
the
earliest
to
arrive
at
the
tent.
Badri’s
buffaloes
were
tied
nearby
and
according
to
Damu,
they
had
to
do
‘high
jumps’
over
the
pats
of
buffalo
dung.



“Second
row
from
the
front,
middle
of
the
row.
Perfect!”
said
Shabbo,
settling
down
on
the
durrie
with
a
happy
sigh.

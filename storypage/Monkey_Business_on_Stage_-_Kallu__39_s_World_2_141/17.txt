From
where
he
sat,
Kallu
could
see
Masterji
in
the
wings
frantically
waving
his
arms
and
pointing
to
Ravan’s
face.
About
to
start
his
lines,
Hanuman
turned
to
look
at
the
audience
in
surprise.
This
was
a
serious
scene.
What
was
making
them
laugh?
&nbsp;
“Kya
hua?”
he
asked,
peering
into
the
dark.
“Why
are
you
laughing?”
&nbsp;
“Ravan’s
moustache
is
falling
off,
Badri
Bhaiya!”
someone
kindly
informed
him
from
the
back.
&nbsp;
“Oh
ho!
Sorry!”
Ravan
jumped
nervously
and
quickly
fixed
the
moustache
back
in
place,
and
then
turned
a
sweaty
face
towards
Mandodari,
“What
do
I
say
next?”
In
his
panic
he
forgot
to
whisper,
and
everyone
began
to
laugh
again.

“Well,
tomorrow
we
won’t
need
the
seats,”
said
Kallu,
giving
Munia
and
Saru
a
sneaky
grin.
“We
boys
will
be
on
stage.”
&nbsp;
“Hah!”
Munia
shook
her
curly
head.
“All
you
do
is
jump
around
like
idiots,
and
none
of
you
have
a
single
line
to
say.”
&nbsp;
“And
Shabbo
will
be
killed
by
Meghnad
and
just
lie
there
flat
on
his
back,
like
a
log
of
wood,”
added
Saru
with
a
giggle.
&nbsp;
“Do
you
know
it
takes
real
acting
to
play
dead?”
Shabbo
asked
hotly.
“I
have
to
breathe
very,
very
slowly
and
keep
my
eyes
shut
tight!”
&nbsp;
“You’ll
get
the
award
for
the
best
dead
monkey
in
Khajuria!”
Damu
grinned.&nbsp;As
the
sun
set,
the
tent
began
to
fill
up.

This
year,
their
begging
had
paid
off
and
Masterji
had
let
Kallu,
Damu
and
Shabbo
play
monkeys
in
the
vanar
sena.
They
were
acting
in
the
final
battle
scene
and
had
to
wear
shorts,
have
monkey
face
make-up
and
long
tails.
It
was
amazing
fun
as
they
jumped
about
waving
tin
maces
and
swords.
It
made
the
girls,
Munia
and
Saru
very
envious.
&nbsp;
“It’s
sooo
silly!”
Saru
said
grimly
as
they
headed
for
the
school
one
morning.
“Why
can’t
girls
act
in
the
Ramlila?”
&nbsp;
“Did
you
see
‘Sita’
last
night?”
Munia
asked.
“That
boy
studies
in
Kallu
Bhaiya’s
class
and
he’s
starting
to
get
a
moustache…”
&nbsp;
“And
his
voice
kept
cracking,”
Saru
giggled.
“I
really
think
Billo
Chachi
would
be
just
perfect
as
Sita.”

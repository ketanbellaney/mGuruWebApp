Masterji
was
the
head
of
the
village
school
and
the
Khajuria
Ramlila
Party
that
put
up
a
fantastic
show
every
year.
Of
course,
they
couldn’t
do
the
whole
Ramayana
because
that
was
a
very
long
story,
and
Khajuria
did
not
have
enough
actors.
So
Masterji
had
written
the
dialogues
of
some
of
the
most
important
scenes,
and
he
would
pick
a
few
of
them
to
enact
for
a
week
before
Dussehra.
So
Khajuria
never
knew
which
scenes
they
would
see.


A
tent
was
put
up
in
a
corner
of
the
field
where
Badri,
the
milkman
kept
his
buffaloes.
A
stage
was
built
with
a
bunch
of
wobbly
folding
tables
they
got
from
Jai
Bhagwan’s
Tent
House.
The
audience
sat
on
the
ground
on
durries
and
nowadays,
as
the
village
had
electricity,
they
had
both
gas
lamps
and
electric
bulbs
to
light
up
the
stage.

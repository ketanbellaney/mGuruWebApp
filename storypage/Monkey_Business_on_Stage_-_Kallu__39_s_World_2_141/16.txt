“Who
is
this?”
Mandodari
whispered
to
Chhotey,
prompting
away.
“Umm…”
Ravan
bent
his
head
towards
her,
listened
and
then
said
loudly,
“Who
is
this?”


A
rakshasa
stepped
forward,
“We
caught
him
in
the
Ashokavan,
Maharaj!
He
was
talking
to
Devi
Sita.”
&nbsp;
“What…”
prompted
Mandodari.
“WHAT!”
shouted
Ravan
springing
up,
suddenly
remembering
the
rest
of
his
lines,
“How
did
he
get
inside?
What
was
he
doing
there?”
and
he
waved
his
arms
in
rage.



Munia
gave
a
soft
giggle,
and
then
as
other
people
spotted
Ravan’s
face,
the
rest
of
the
audience
also
began
to
laugh.
As
he
was
waving
his
arms,
Ravan
had
dislodged
one
end
of
his
false
moustache,
and
now
it
was
dangling
over
his
lips
like
a
black
earthworm.

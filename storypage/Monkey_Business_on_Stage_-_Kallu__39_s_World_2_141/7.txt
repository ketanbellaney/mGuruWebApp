“Yes
she
would!
Now
if
her
husband
Dharam
Chacha
can
play
Ram,
why
can’t
she
be
Sita?”
&nbsp;
“She
even
asked
Masterji,
but
he
said
that
the
Khajuria
panchayat
would
stop
the
Ramlila
if
he
took
real
women.
Dhat!”
Saru
shook
her
head
in
disgust.



“Anyway,
tonight’s
Badri
Bhaiya’s
big
scene!”
Munia
gave
a
small
skip
of
happiness.
“I
can’t
wait!”
&nbsp;
For
Kallu
and
his
gang,
the
best
actor
in
the
show
was
Badri,
the
mad
buffalo
man
who
always
played
Hanuman.
He
was
short
and
stocky,
had
a
head
of
unruly
hair,
a
bushy
moustache,
big
round
eyes
and
a
booming
voice.
So
when
he
was
on
stage,
strutting
about
yelling
out
his
lines,
even
Ram
and
Laxman
faded
into
the
background.

“Masterji
really
struggled
to
make
Chhotey
remember
his
lines,”
Damu
whispered.
“He
mixes
up
everything.”
&nbsp;
“And
then
Masterji
solved
the
problem!”
Kallu
grinned.
&nbsp;
The
others
turned
to
look
at
him,
“How?”
“Watch
Narain’s
lips,
he’s
prompting
Chhotey.
&nbsp;
Masterji
made
him
learn
the
lines
of
both
Mandodari
and
Ravan!”
whispered
Kallu.



“Sooo
clever!”
breathed
Munia
in
admiration.
“Here
he
comes!”
said
Saru
with
an
excited
wriggle
as
Hanuman
was
dragged
on
to
the
stage
by
the
rakshasas.
They
leaned
forward,
eyes
glued
to
Hanuman,
who
was
all
tied
up
in
thick
ropes
but
stood
defiantly
tall,
glaring
angrily
at
Ravan.

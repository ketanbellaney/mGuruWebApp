He
would
stand
tall,
thump
his
chest
and
ask
angrily,
“Thieving
monkey?
Who
are
you
to
call
me
that?
Do
you
know
who
I
am?”
and
then
turning
to
face
the
audience,
he
would
launch
into
the
poem
that
Shabbo
knew
by
heart…


Main
hooon
Ramji
ka
chela
Main
hoon
Hanuman
albela
Tu
hai
Ravan
balwaan
Kar
du
tujhko
pareshan
&nbsp;
Then
he
would
pause
dramatically,
thump
his
chest
again
and
say
in
ringing
tones…

Main
hoon
pavan
putra
Hanumaaan!
As
they
waited
breathlessly,
Hanuman
glared
at
Ravan
and
shouted,
“Do
you
know
who
I
am?”
He
turned
to
face
the
audience,
cleared
his
throat
and
suddenly
Badri
began
to
sing!

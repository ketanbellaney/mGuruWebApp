“He’s
an
artist
and
all
artists
are
crazy
anyway.
This
year
in
the
Bharat
milap
scene,
he
wanted
Ram
and
Bharat
to
sing
a
song,”
said
Dharampal.



“A
song?”
repeated
Badri.“Yes.
It
went
-
bhai
bhai
ka
pyar
amar
rahe…
something…
something…”
Dharampal
laughed.
&nbsp;
“But
you
can’t
sing!”
said
Badri.
“Exactly!
And
neither
can
Lattu,
who’s
playing
Bharat!
He
tried
for
two
days
to
make
us
sing
and
then
gave
up.
Thank
God!”
said
Dharampal.
&nbsp;
Suddenly,
Badri
sat
up
and
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
voice,
making
Dharampal
jump,
“Masterji!
Masterji!”
“Kya
hua?”
Masterji
came
running
in
a
panic.

From
the
first
day,
Kallu
and
his
gang
were
hanging
around
the
school
building
where
rehearsals
were
held,
hoping
Masterji
would
give
them
something
to
do.
In
the
gang
were
Kallu,
his
sister
Munia,
brother
Shabbo
and
his
best
friend
Damu
and
his
sister
Saru.
Day
after
day,
they
sat
and
watched
the
rehearsals,
and
by
the
end
they
knew
most
of
the
dialogues
by
heart.
&nbsp;
Every
year,
Masterji
would
select
scenes
like
the
Sita
swayamvar
with
Ram
breaking
the
giant
bow;
then
Kaikeyi
and
Manthara
scheming
to
send
Ram
into
exile
and
Dasaratha
weeping
and
dying.
Munia’s
favourite
scene
was
of
Laxman
cutting
off
Surpanakha’s
nose
and
Ravan
kidnapping
Sita.
Then
there
was
Hanuman
setting
fire
to
Lanka,
and
finally
the
fantastic
battle
scenes
with
Ravan,
Kumbhakarna
and
Meghnad
fighting
Ram,
Laxman,
Hanuman
and
their
monkey
army.

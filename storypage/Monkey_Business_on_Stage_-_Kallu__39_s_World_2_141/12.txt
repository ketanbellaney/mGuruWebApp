“You
wrote
a
song
for
Ram
but
not
for
Hanuman?
And
I
can
sing!”
said
Badri.
&nbsp;
“Arrey
Badri!”
Masterji
stuffed
a
paan
into
his
mouth,
“Hanuman
does
not
sing.”
&nbsp;
“And
what
will
you
sing
anyway?”
asked
Dharampal
carefully
painting
Badri’s
nose
a
bright
red.



“Hanuman-Ravan
ki
dushmani
amar
rahe?”
“Heh…
heh…
ho…
ho…”
Masterji
walked
away
laughing,
spraying
paan
juice
in
the
air.


As
Dharampal
began
to
attach
the
tail
to
Badri’s
bright
yellow
shorts,
nobody
noticed
the
thoughtful
look
on
Badri-Hanuman’s
brown
face…

Backstage
was
a
hive
of
activity,
with
everyone
putting
on
their
costumes
and
slapping
on
make-up.
Dharampal
was
free
tonight,
as
Ram
did
not
appear
in
the
scene,
so
he
was
busy
doing
the
Hanuman
make-up
on
Badri’s
face.
&nbsp;
“I
wish
you
would
shave
off
your
moustache
Badri,”
he
said.
“It
looks
really
odd.
Hanuman
on
TV
and
films
is
always
clean-shaven.”
&nbsp;
“Colour
it
brown
and
no
one
will
know,”
growled
Badri.


“I
am
NOT
shaving
it!
FORGET
IT!!”
Then
he
held
the
sheets
of
dialogue
before
his
face,
squinted
and
grumbled,
“Why
does
Masterji
keep
changing
the
dialogues
every
year?”

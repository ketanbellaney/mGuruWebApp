In
the
wings,
Masterji
was
chewing
his
paan
faster
and
faster…&nbsp;
“Tell
me
who
you
are…
you
thieving
monkey!”
Mandodari
prompted.
&nbsp;
“What?”
Ravan
was
still
a
bit
flustered.
“Theek!
Tell
me
who
you
are…
you
thieving
monkey!”
And
he
finally
turned
to
address
Hanuman,
“Where
have
you
come
from?”
&nbsp;
“Here
it
comes!”
Shabbo
leaned
forward
eagerly,
“My
favourite
dialogue.”
&nbsp;
Masterji
had
written
some
of
the
important
dialogues
in
rhyme,
and
the
bit
where
Hanuman
introduces
himself
to
Ravan
was
the
best
poetry
Shabbo
had
ever
heard.
And
Badri’s
acting
was
always
quite
superb!

One
rakshasa
was
swaying
his
hips
in
a
really
funny
dance.
Badri
began
to
smile,
and
with
a
happy
shake
of
his
head,
he
decided
to
sing
the
whole
song
once
again!


As
he
got
to
the
last
line,
he
waved
to
the
crowd
to
join
in
and
then
sang
out,
Main
hoon
pavan
putra…
And
the
audience
joined
in
a
loud
shout,
Hanumaaaan!
&nbsp;
From
the
field
outside,
Badri’s
loyal
buffaloes
joined
in
the
chorus,
“Mooo!
Moooooo!”
&nbsp;
As
they
headed
for
home
tiredly,
Kallu
declared
with
a
huge,
happy
sigh,
“What
a
super-hit
Ramlila!”

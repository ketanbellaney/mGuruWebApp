An
hour
later,
the
curtains
were
dragged
away
to
reveal
Ravan's
royal
durbar
in
Lanka,
and
it
looked
really
gorgeous
with
carpets,
curtains
and
thrones,
all
supplied
by
Jai
Bhagwan's
tent
house.
Jai
Bhagwan
was
playing
Kumbhakarna
because
he
was
the
fattest
man
in
the
village.

The
scene
was
going
beautifully
and
the
audience
was
absorbed
in
the
action.
Ravan
was
being
played
by
Chhotey
Lal,
the
village
wrestler
and
Mandodari
by
Narain,
who
was
in
class
ten,
wearing
a
pink
and
gold
sari.



Ravan
looked
really
threatening
with
his
rippling
muscles,
bushy
eyebrows,
curling
moustache
and
big
eyes.
The
only
problem
was
that
Chhotey
wasnâ€™t
very
good
at
remembering
the
dialogues.

Khajuria
village
was
suffering
from
Ramlila
fever.
It
was
nothing
new,
as
Kallu
said,
they
got
it
every
year.
The
fever
usually
started
a
month
before
Dussehra.
As
the
low,
dark
grey
monsoon
clouds
drifted
away
and
the
sky
turned
a
glittering
blue,
there
were
festivities
in
the
air
and
everyone
began
talking
about
Masterji
and
the
Ramlila.
&nbsp;
Everywhere
in
the
village,
at
Dharampal’s
chai
shop,
in
the
vegetable
fields,
at
the
grocery
store,
in
Moti
Dadi’s
courtyard
and
at
the
tube-well,
there
was
a
single
question
being
asked.
&nbsp;
“What
is
Masterji
planning
to
do
this
year?”


Kallu
often
said
admiringly,
“Masterji
is
the
producer,
director,
scriptwriter
and
music
composer
of
Ramlila
and
only
he
knows
what
we
will
see
this
year.”

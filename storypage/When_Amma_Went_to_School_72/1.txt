“Meera,
I
went
to
your
school
today!”
Amma
said
one
day.
“Really?”
Meera&nbsp;
said.
“And
the
gate
was
wide
open,
and
the
watchman
was
missing!”
“Oh!
He&nbsp;
was&nbsp;
in&nbsp;
our&nbsp;
classroom,
to&nbsp;
see&nbsp;
why&nbsp;
our&nbsp;
teacher&nbsp;
had&nbsp;
screamed!”
“And
why
did
your
teacher
scream?”
Amma
asked.
“Because&nbsp;
Rohan&nbsp;
began&nbsp;
crying!”

“That&nbsp;
is&nbsp;
because&nbsp;
we&nbsp;
had&nbsp;
all&nbsp;
run&nbsp;
away&nbsp;
to&nbsp;
the&nbsp;
Principal’s&nbsp;
Room,”
Meera&nbsp;
said.
“Because&nbsp;
Rohan&nbsp;
said&nbsp;
the&nbsp;
snake&nbsp;
was&nbsp;
following&nbsp;
us!”
“But
when
I
went
to
the
Principal’s
Room,
it
was
empty!”
Amma
said.

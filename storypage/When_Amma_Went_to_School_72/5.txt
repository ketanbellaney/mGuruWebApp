“We&nbsp;
couldn’t&nbsp;
stay&nbsp;
there,”
Meera&nbsp;
said,
“because&nbsp;
Rohan’s&nbsp;
snake&nbsp;
was&nbsp;
looking&nbsp;
for&nbsp;
him.&nbsp;
We&nbsp;
climbed&nbsp;
up&nbsp;
to&nbsp;
the&nbsp;
terrace&nbsp;
and&nbsp;
stayed&nbsp;
there&nbsp;
till&nbsp;
the&nbsp;
bell&nbsp;
rang!”
“And
I
waited
and
waited
in
your
school,
all
alone!”
Amma
said.

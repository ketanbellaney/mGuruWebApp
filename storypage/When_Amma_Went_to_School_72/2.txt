“And
why
did
Rohan
cry?”
Amma
wanted
to
know.
“Because&nbsp;
the&nbsp;
snake&nbsp;
he&nbsp;
had&nbsp;
brought&nbsp;
back&nbsp;
from&nbsp;
the&nbsp;
zoo&nbsp;
had&nbsp;
eaten&nbsp;
his&nbsp;
mouse!
And&nbsp;
then&nbsp;
the
teacher&nbsp;
screamed&nbsp;
and&nbsp;
the&nbsp;
watchman&nbsp;
came&nbsp;
running!”
“But
I
went
to
your
classroom,
and
there
was
nobody
there!”
said
Amma.

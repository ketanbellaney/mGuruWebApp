When
Loco,
the
lovely
new
train
was
rolled
into
the
railway
shed,
all
the
older
trains
admired
its
fine
face
and
figure.
“Oh,
you
will
soon
go
to
all
kinds
of
strange
and
new
places.
What
wonderful
adventures
you
will
have!”
they
promised.
But
Loco
did
not
want
any
adventures
—
it
was,
you
see,
a
frightened
little
train
—
not
little
at
all,
of
course,
but
it
was
so
scared
of
everything
that
it
felt
tiny!

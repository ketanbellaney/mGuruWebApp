A
wise
old
train
who
had
been
all
over
the
country
saw
how
frightened
Loco
looked,
and
pointed
out
that
it
was
much
bigger
than
dogs
and
cows.
But
Loco
was
not
sure.
“Oh,
but
they
are
all
so
strong
and
fierce.
I
don’t
want
to
go
anywhere
alone,”
it
said.
So
the
old
train
said,
“But
you
won’t
be
alone,
dear
Loco.
The
engine
driver
and
the
guard
will
be
with
you.”

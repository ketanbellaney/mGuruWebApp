“Oooo,”
it
cried
in
fright
but
what
do
you
suppose
happened?
It
came
out
sounding
exactly
like
a
sharp
train
whistle!
Some
mynahs
pecking
nearby
quickly
flew
off
cackling.
And
as
it
thundered
on,
off
flew
all
the
crows
and
sparrows
and
other
birds
perched
on
wires
along
the
railway
track
in
great
fright.
Loco
was
really
surprised
that
anybody
could
be
frightened
of
it,
and
laughed.

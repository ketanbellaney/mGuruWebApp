It
didn't
want
to
leave
the
railway
shed.
It
shrank
when
the
cows
in
the
fields
bellowed,
but
felt
comforted
by
the
friendly,
older
trains
around.
&nbsp;
It
was
scared
even
when
a
dog
ran
barking
towards
it,
and
wished
it
could
hide
somewhere
safer!
But
how
was
it
to
hide
anywhere,
and
how
could
it
always
stay
in
the
shed?

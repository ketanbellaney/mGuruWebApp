Soon
the
big
day
arrived
when
Loco
was
rolled
out
of
the
yard
for
its
maiden
journey.
Loco
was
to
go
all
the
way
across
from
Tamil
Nadu
near
the
sea
to
Jammu
next
to
the
mountains.
&nbsp;
Babu,
the
engine
driver
pushed
some
buttons,
and
twisted
some
knobs,
and
off
chugged
Loco
from
the
station,
its
heart
in
its
mouth.

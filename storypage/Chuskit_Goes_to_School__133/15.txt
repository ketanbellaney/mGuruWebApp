“That's
exactly
what
we
have
to
workout,”
said
the
Headmaster.&nbsp;
“I
hear
that
in&nbsp;
the
village
of
Mentok
Yul,
the
Village
Education
Committee
has
helped
build
a
special
toilet
for
one
of
their
disabled
children.
We
could
ask
them
what
they
have
done.
But
first
we
will
have
to
get
Chuskit
to
school.
Then
we
could
think
of
ways
of
helping
her
do
things
in
school.”

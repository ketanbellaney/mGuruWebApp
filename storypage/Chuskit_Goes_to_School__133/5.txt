Chuskit
would
sit
at
the
kitchen
window
everyday
and
draw
what
she
saw
while
her&nbsp;Ama-ley
cooked.
She
could
see
her
family's
animals
being&nbsp;taken
to
graze
every
morning.

She
could
see
the
blue
waters&nbsp;of
the
stream
that
flowed
near&nbsp;by.
And
she
would
be
the
first&nbsp;one
to
announce
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
to
their
house!

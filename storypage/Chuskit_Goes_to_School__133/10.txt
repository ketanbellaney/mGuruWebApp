“Of
course!”
replied
Chuskit.
“I&nbsp;hear
my
younger
brother
talk&nbsp;of
all
that
he
does
at
school.
I
want
to
study
like
all
of
you,&nbsp;make
friends,
play
games,
wear
a
uniform
and
even
write&nbsp;exams.
Sometimes
my
brother
teaches
me
songs
that
he
has&nbsp;learnt
at
school
and
I
love
it.
You
may
not
believe
this,
but
I&nbsp;sometimes
dream
of
carrying
a&nbsp;school
bag,
even
eating
packed&nbsp;lunch...”

“Enough!
Enough!”
interrupted
her
grandfather.
“Stop
dreaming,
Chuskit.
You
know
you
cannot
go
to
school.
I
have
told
you
this
many
times.
Learn
as
much
as
you
can
at
home.”

The
next
day
the
Headmaster
called
all
the
teachers
to
a
meeting.
He
shared
Abdul’s
ideas
with
the
group
and
asked
the
teachers
what
they
felt.
“Impossible!”
said
one
of
them.
“How
can
we
have
a
disabled
child
in
our
school?
How
will
she
be
able
to
write,
play
and
go
to
the
toilet
like
the&nbsp;other
children
do?”

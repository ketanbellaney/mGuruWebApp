“Meme-ley,
please,”
pleaded
Chuskit
softly
with
tears
in
her&nbsp;eyes
as
her
grandfather
walked&nbsp;away
angrily.
“Meme-ley
does
not
understand
how
I
feel,”
said
Chuskit.
“I
remember
the
day
my
brother
recited
his
tables
with
such
pride,
even
the
time
he
learned
to
read!
My
parents
were
very
happy
as
they
have
never
been
to
school.
I
too
want
to
learn
to
read
and
do
math.
Do
you
understand?”

“I
do,”
said
Abdul.
“Chuskit,
I
will
see
you
again.
I
must
go
now.
My
mother
will
be
waiting&nbsp;for
me.
Julley!”

Chuskit
had
been
awake
for
the
last
hour.
This
was
a
day
she
was
going
to
remember
for
a
long
time.
Can
you
guess
why?




No,
it
was
not
Losar,
the
New&nbsp;Year
festival.
That
was
many&nbsp;months
away.
Nor
was
it
any&nbsp;special
day
in
her
village,
like&nbsp;the
gonpa
festival,
or
a
wedding
day.


Today
was
going
to
be

Chuskit's
first
day
at
school.
At
nine
years,
she
had
waited&nbsp;a
long,
long
time
for
this.&nbsp;

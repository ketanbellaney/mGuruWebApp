Chuskit’s
parents
provided
everyone
with
hot
tea
and
biscuits.
Chuskit’s
grandfather
sat
under
a
willow
tree
by
the
stream
watching
the
busy
school
children.
“I
never
dreamt
I’d
see
a
day
like
this!”
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
wiped
a
tear
that
rolled
down
his
cheek.



At
the
end
of
the
day
it
was
a
tired
but
happy
group
of
children
that
returned
to
their
homes.
The
path
from&nbsp;Chuskit’s
home
to
the
school&nbsp;was
now
ready!

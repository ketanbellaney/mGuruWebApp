“Now
I
won’t
have
to
carry
Chuskit
everywhere.
I
can
wheel
her
around,”
said
Ama-ley,
with
tears
of
happiness
in
her
eyes.
“And
I
will
be
able
to
go
wherever
I
want!”
cried
Chuskit&nbsp;excitedly.



“Please,
please,
could
I
ride
on
your
wheelchair
once
in
a
way?”
begged
Stobdan.
He
wanted
to
wheel
it
around&nbsp;too.
It
looked
like
fun.
Billa,
the&nbsp;big
black
cat,
jumped
on
to
the
wheel-chair
and
stretched
across
the
seat.
“Yes
this
is
far
more
comfortable
than&nbsp;the
sack
cloth
I
sleep
on,”
she
purred.

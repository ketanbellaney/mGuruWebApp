Chuskit
was
born
with
legs&nbsp;
that
did
not
work
like
everyone&nbsp;else’s.
Her
father
had
taken
her&nbsp;to
the
village
amchi
and
then
to
the
doctors
in
Leh.
But
no&nbsp;amount
of
medicine
had
helped
her
walk.
At
first,
Chuskit
did
not
realise
that
she
was
in
any
way
different
from
the
Stobdan&nbsp;her
younger
brother,
or
her
cousins.
But
soon
there
were
many
things
she
could
not
do
as
easily
as
them.




“That
does
not
matter,”
her
Aba-ley
would
tell
her
whenever
she
felt
sad.
“You
can
stitch
better
than
any
of
them.
And
you
draw
very
well.”
Aba-ley
often
brought
her
some
colour
pencils
from
Leh.

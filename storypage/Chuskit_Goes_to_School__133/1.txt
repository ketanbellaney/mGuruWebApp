Chuskit
woke
up
early
that
morning.
It
was
a
very
special&nbsp;day
and
she
was
too
excited
to&nbsp;sleep.
She
eagerly
looked
out&nbsp;of
the
room
through
the
window
next
to
her
bed.

It
was
spring
time
in
Ladakh

and
the
apricot
trees
were
in&nbsp;full
bloom.
Two
magpies
had&nbsp;already
begun
their
day
and
were
busy
looking
for
insects&nbsp;to
eat.
Her
Ama-ley
was
awake&nbsp;too.
She
could
hear
her
in
the&nbsp;kitchen
making
gur-gur
tea.

“Yes,
Azhang-ley.
She
uses
a
wheelchair
to
move&nbsp;around
but
cannot
reach
school,
as
the
path
from
her
home
is
too
rough
and
uneven.
I
was
wondering
if
we
could
do
anything
to
help
her,
Azhang-ley.
We
could
all
get
together
and
level
the
path
and
also
build
a
small
bridge
across
the
stream.”


“That’s
very
thoughtful
of
you,
Abdul,”
said
the&nbsp;Headmaster
as
he
patted
him
on
the
back.
“What&nbsp;made
you
think
of
Chuskit
and
her
problems?”


“Azhang-ley,
last
week
we
read
about
the
fundamental
rights
of
citizens
in
our
civics
class.&nbsp;All
children
have
a
right
to
education.
That
includes
Chuskit
as
well,
does
it
not?”



“Yes,
you
are
right,
Abdul.
Let
me
discuss
this
with
the
other
teachers,”
replied
the
Headmaster.

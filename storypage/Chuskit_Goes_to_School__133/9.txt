One
evening
when
Chuskit
was
sitting
outside
the&nbsp;house
with
her
grandfather,
a
young
boy
came
up&nbsp;to
her.
He
carried
a
letter
which
he
handed
over
to
her
grandfather.
“Julley!
The
bus
driver
asked
me
to
give
this
to
you,”
he
said.
“My
name
is
Abdul,”
he
said
turning
to
Chuskit.
“I
study
Class
6
at
the
Government
School.
I
have
often
wondered
why
you
don’t
come
to
school.”

“Julley,
Abdul,”
said
Chuskit.
“I
have
never
been
to
school.
The
path
to
the
school
is
too
uneven
and
pebbly
and
my
wheelchair
will
get
stuck.
Besides,
I
cannot
cross
the
little
stream
in
front
of
the
school.
It
would
be
very
difficult
for
my
parents
to
carry
me
to
school
and
back
everyday.”

“But
would
you
like
to
come
to
school?”
asked
Abdul.

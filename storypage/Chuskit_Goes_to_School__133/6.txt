Chuskit
used
a
chair
fitted
with&nbsp;wheels
to
move
around.
Elders&nbsp;called
it
a
wheelchair.
You
could
move
it
in
any
direction-
forward,
left,
right
and&nbsp;even
backward
-
by
moving
the
wheels
with
your
hands.
You
only
needed
to
have
really
strong
arms
to
push
the
weight
of
your
body
and
the
chair.

When
Aba-ley
first
brought
the
wheelchair
home,
everyone
in
her
family
was
very
excited.

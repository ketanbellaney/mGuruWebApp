The
next
day,
Abdul
went
straight
to
the
Headmaster’s
room
after
assembly.


“Julley,
Azhang-ley!”
he
said.
“I
want
to
talk
to
you
about
a
girl
from
our
village
who
does
not
go
to
school.
Her
name
is
Chuskit.
She
is
Stobdan’s
sister.”




“Oh
yes,”
replied
the
Headmaster.
“I
know
her.
She
is
disabled,
isn’t
she?”

Slowly,
Chuskit
learnt
to
use
her
wheelchair.
She
would
ask&nbsp;her
mother
to
seat
her
in
the&nbsp;wheelchair
outside
her
home&nbsp;every
evening.


From
here
she
would
watch
children
returning
from
school,
chattering
and
laughing
merrily
in
groups.
In
a
while,
the
evening
bus
would
return
from
Leh,
bringing
back
people
from
work
and
the
market
place.
How
much
more
exciting
the
world
was
from
here
than
from
the
kitchen
window!

The
school
was
not
very
far
away
from
her
home.
To
get
there,
you
had
to
walk
up
to
the
main
road.
Just
before
the
prayer
wheel,
you
took
the
path
to
the
left
of
the
road
that
ran
along
a
narrow&nbsp;stream.
Near
the
poplar
trees&nbsp;you
crossed
the
stream
by
jumping
over
the
big
rocks.

Once
you
got
to
the
other

side,
a
short
walk
up
a
slope

took
you
to
the
school.
All

the
children
of
Skitpo
Yul,

Chuskit's
village,
walked
to

school
everyday
and
with

ease.
But
not
little
Chuskit.
She
had
a
disability
and
could
not
walk.

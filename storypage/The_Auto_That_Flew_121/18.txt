In
boundless
quiet
above
all
the
honking
cars,
Arjun
missed
the
roads
of
his
life,
jammed
with
cars,
motorcycles
and
buses.
Below,
he
saw
his
family
at
work,
dots
of
yellow
canopy
glowing
bright
like
beacons.


Arjun
even
missed
the
rush
and
bustle
of
people,
all
so
eager
to
arrive
somewhere
else.
Places
to
go,
places
to
go...pht-pht-tuka-tuka-tuk...

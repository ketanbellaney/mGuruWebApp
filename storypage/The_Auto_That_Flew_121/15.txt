Arjun
flew
high
above
Jawaharlal
Nehru
Stadium
and
India
Gate.
He
looked
upon
Humayun's
Tomb,
the
Yamuna
River
and
the
gracious
temple
of
Akshardham.
He
saw
a
giant
web
of
roads,
like
the
work
of
a
crazy
spider.


Wide-eyed,
Sirishji
began
shrieking
with
the
fun
of
it
all.
He
no
longer
gripped
the
handlebar,
no
longer
dodged
cars.

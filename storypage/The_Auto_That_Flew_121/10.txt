Sirishji
smiled
broadly,
showing
the
woman
his
paan-stained
teeth.
He
drank
quickly
and
the
traffic
budged.




“Already
the
magic
is
working,”
Sirishji
joked.
The
woman
drank
too,
spilling
a
little
on
Arjun
as
he
started
forward.
&nbsp;Pht-pht-tuka-tuka-tuk

&nbsp;went
Arjun,
beeping
a
cheery
hello
to
one
of
his
brothers.

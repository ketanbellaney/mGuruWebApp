Arjun
worked
hard,
day
and
night.&nbsp;


Pht-pht-tuka-
tuka-tuk,
&nbsp;
he
went.
&nbsp;
Pht-pht-tuka-tuka-tuk!
&nbsp;He
never
complained
because
Autowallah
Sirish
worked
hard
too.
Sirishji
had
old
bones
that
caused
him
pain.
He
decorated
Arjun’s
dashboard
with
plastic
flowers
and
pictures
of
movie
stars.
He
quenched
Arjun’s
thirst
for
clean
gas,
even
when
the
queues
were
long.
And
whenever
Arjun’s
canopy
was
torn,
he
wasted
no
time
taking
it
to
be
patched.

Sirishji
became
busy
again,
drinking
in
the
familiar
magic
of
the
city.
Every
sign
and
every
turning
spoke
to
him.
Very
soon
he
could
recognise
himself
again.
He
knew
where
he
was
going.
He
was
already
there.
The
woman’s
saree
became
dull,
but
her
face
was
bright.
Down
to
earth
they
came.


Arjun’s
wheels
touched
warm
asphalt
and
his
engine
sighed
with
relief.
Pht-pht-tuka-tuka-tuk...&nbsp;
“Go
carefully,”
beeped
a
brother
from
the
street
corner.

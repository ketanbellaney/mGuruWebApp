But
secretly,
Arjun
did
wish
for
more.
Secretly,
he
wanted
to
fly.
Oh,
to
have
helicopter
blades!
Arjun
thought.
They
would
chop
the
air
above
his
canopy.
Sirishji
would
wrap
his
head
in
a
scarf,
and
the
ends
of
it
would
flap
gaily
in
the
breeze.
Off
they
would
go,&nbsp;pht-pht-tuka-tuka-tuk
&nbsp;in
the
sky!

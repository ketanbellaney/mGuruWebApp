Bulbuli
and
Totaram
giggled.
So
did
the
jungles.
This
time
the
noise
level
rose
not
because
of
the
fighting,
but
with
laughter.
Bulbuli
was
relieved
to
see
the
war
coming
to
an
end.
She
realised
that
the
jungles
had
each
been
able
to
feel
pride
in
their
uniqueness.
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
asked
Totaram
to
collect
bunches
of
tea,
tulsi
leaves
along
with
elaichi
seeds.
“Jungles,
I
am
now
going
to
return
to
my
village
with
the
most
exquisite
and
refreshing
tea,
one
with
tulsi
and
elaichi.
And
I
promise
to
return
with
people
from
my
village
to
introduce
them
to
Senseless
Point.
The
most
refreshing
place
on
earth!”
&nbsp;
That
is
how
tulsi
and
elaichi
flavoured
tea
was
discovered.
Have
you
tried
it
yet?

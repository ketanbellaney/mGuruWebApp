“Totaram!
Can
you
smell
the
freshness
in
the
air?
I
love
it!”
she
told
the
parrot.
“You
have
all
day
to
take
your
whiffs.
Let
us
get
moving,”
ordered
Totaram.
Totaram
and
she
talked
little
the
next
day.
He
could
see
that
Bulbuli
was
tired,
hungry
and
thirsty.
&nbsp;
Totaram
flew
down
to
perch
on
her
shoulder.
“There
is
a
stream
nearby.
We
will
rest
there
for
a
while.”




In
a
little
while,
Bulbuli
heard
the
sound
of
rushing
water.
In
no
time
they
arrived
at
the
stream.
The


clear
water
glistened
in
the
sunlight.
The
water
seemed
to
be
racing
with
itself
to
get
somewhere.
It
was
a
beautiful
sight.
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
leaned
over
and
cupped
the
water
in
her
hands
and
drank
all
that
she
could.
She
splashed
water
on
her
face
and
refreshed
herself.
Just
as
she
was
done,
Totaram
landed
on
her
shoulder
once
again
and
nudged
her
to
stretch
out
her
palms.
He
then
dropped
red,
delicious
berries
in
them.

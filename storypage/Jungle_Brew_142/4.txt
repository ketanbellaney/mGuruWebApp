On
this
particular
morning,
Bulbuli
waited
for
Totaram’s
whistle.
She
fed
the
hens
and
collected
their
eggs.
Next
she
fed
the
cows
and
then
milked
them.
All
the
while
she
paused
from
time
to
time
to
listen
to
Totaram’s
call.
Tired
of
waiting,
she
left
for
her
school.
All
the
students
in
her
school
sat
under
a
huge
banyan
tree.

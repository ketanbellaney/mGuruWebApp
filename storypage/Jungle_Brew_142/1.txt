In
a
little
hilly
hamlet
of
southern
India,
lived
a
young
girl
called
Bulbuli.
She
lived
in
a
hut
with
her
mother.
Her
house
was
surrounded
by
the
tallest
and
greenest
trees
you
would
have
ever
seen.
On
misty
days,
the
leaves
of
plants
and
trees
held
the
biggest
dewdrops
you
could
imagine.
Bulbuli
was
as
sprightly
as
her
name.
She,
along
with
her
friends,
would
prance
through
the
endless
forests
around
her
village.
She
loved
to
take
in
deep
breaths
every
morning
as
the
air
carried
all
kinds
of
different
aromas.
Sometimes
she
could
smell
a
sweet,
sweet
fragrance.
At
other
times
it
was
a
strong
and
sharp
scent.
Then
there
were
days
when
all
she
could
smell
was
a
familiar
bouquet.

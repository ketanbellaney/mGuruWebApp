Totaram
grew
even
more
agitated.
“Senseless
Point
is
two
sunrises
and
two
dusks
away.
Your
small
feet
will
not
be
able
to
carry
you
there.”
“My
mind
is
bigger
than
my
feet,
Totaram.
Don’t
let
the
size
of
my
feet
fool
you.
I’m
not
afraid
to
do
difficult
things.
Besides,
the
least
I
can
do
is
try.”


“The
journey
is
long
and
hard,
Bulbuli.
I’m
not
sure…”
mused
Totaram.
“Well,
I
cannot
think
of
any
other
way
to
help.
You
must
take
me
to
Senseless
Point,”
pleaded
Bulbuli.
Totaram
thought
for
a
long
time.
Reluctantly,
he
agreed.
“All
right
then,
but
we
must
leave
immediately,”
he
said.

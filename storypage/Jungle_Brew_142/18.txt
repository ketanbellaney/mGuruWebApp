The
fragrances
and
the
musical
notes
played
in
her
head,
over
and
over
again.
All
her
senses
were
alive.
This
was
a
magical
moment
for
her.
Never
before
had
she
felt
so
delighted.
&nbsp;
Just
then,
the
elaichi
plant
spoke,
“Maybe
this
little
girl
could
punish
the
tea
bushes.”
&nbsp;
“Maybe.
Little
girl,
can
you
stop
the
tea
bushes
from
stealing
our
fragrance?”
asked
a
Tulsi
plant.
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
was
stunned
to
hear
the
jungles
speak
to
her.
Before
she
could
respond,
a
tea
bush
spoke
up.
“Maybe
if
these
two
were
not
around,
humans
might
be
able
to
ap-preciate
our
aroma.”

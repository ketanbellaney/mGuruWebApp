“Oh
Totaram!
You
are
the
nicest
friend
I
know.
Thank
you
so
much,”
smiled
Bulbuli.
“Go
ahead
and
eat
them.
Berries
are
my
favourite
food.
I
have
already
eaten
too
many
today!”
gushed
Totaram.
They
rested
for
a
while
and
then
set
out
once
again.
Bulbuli
walked
and
walked
while
Totaram
flew
just
above
her
talking
to
her
all
the
while.
&nbsp;
After
several
hours,
Bulbuli
sat
down.
“I
need
to
rest
Totaram.
I
am
really
very
exhausted.
Totaram
let
out
a
loud
whistle.
Within
minutes,
an
elephant
strolled
up
to
them.
Totaram
introduced
Hathi
to
Bulbuli
and
told
him
of
their
journey
to
Senseless
Point.
&nbsp;
“I
believe
only
a
human
can
help
the
war
in
the
jungle.
Animals
are
running
away
from
what
is
paradise
for
us,”
said
a
concerned
Hathi.
“Will
you
give
Bulbuli
a
ride,
Hathi?”
asked
Totaram.
“Her
will
is
strong
but
her
strength
is
failing.”

“Is
that
what
this
war
is
all
about,
worrying
about
your
smells
getting
stolen?”
asked
a
puzzled
Bulbuli.
She
smiled
to
herself.
“Do
you
have
any
idea
what
you
all
smell
like
from
where
I
stand?
I
can
smell
each
of
you
distinctly.”
&nbsp;
“It
really
is
not
our
fault.
We
are
not
fragrance
thieves.
Our
leaves
take
on
the
smell
of
anything
that
grows
around
us.
In
fact,
with
tulsi
and
elaichi
around
us,
we
have
to
work
extra
hard
to
keep
our
identity.
It
is
not
as
if
the
tulsi
jungle
and
the
elaichi
jungle
have
lost
their
perfume
to
me.
You
just
said
that
you
can
smell
their
individual
whiff,”
said
a
tea
bush.
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
took
several
deep
breaths
to
calm
down.
She
discovered
that
every
time
she
took
in
a
collected
breath
of
tea,
elaichi
and
tulsi,
it
helped
her
relax.
There
was
something
very
soothing
about
the
three
of
them
together.

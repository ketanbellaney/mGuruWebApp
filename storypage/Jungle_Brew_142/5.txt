Bulbuli
could
hardly
pay
attention
to
what
was
being
taught.
Her
eyes
searched
for
Totaram,
who
had
never
missed
visiting
her
ever
since
the
time
they
became
friends.
&nbsp;
Several
days
passed
and
Bulbuli
grew
more
concerned
about
Totaram.
She
worried
that
Totaram
might
be
hurt.
She
had
no
way
of
knowing
if
he
was
safe.
Bulbuli
grew
more
despondent
with
each
day.
After
school,
she
would
walk
through
the
forests
calling
out
to
Totaram.
&nbsp;
“Hello!
Are
you
here
somewhere
Totaram?”
she
would
yell
cupping
her
mouth
with
her
hands.
But
there
was
no
response.

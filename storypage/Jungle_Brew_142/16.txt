In
the
distance,
just
in
front
of
her,
she
could
see
green
beds.
On
her
right,
were
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
shrubs
with
magenta
flowers.
On
her
left,
she
could
see
very
tall
plants.
The
sight
before
her
was
breathtaking.
And
the
aroma
was
stunning.
&nbsp;
Bulbuli’s
face
lit
up
with
wonder.
She
turned
towards
each
jungle
several
times
over,
to
take
in
the
splendour.
Almost
instantly,
the
noise
of
the
jungles
began
to
die
down,
as
if
the
jungles
had
spotted
her.
&nbsp;
That
was
when
Bulbuli
took
her
first
deep
breath.
She
could
smell
the
aroma
of
tea.
Then
in
the
next
breath,
she
was
drawn
to
the
fragrance
on
her
right.
It
was
a
spicy
fragrance-
something
she
was
familiar
with.
Unsure,
she
breathed
in
some
more
and
said
to
herself,
“Ah!
Elaichi!”

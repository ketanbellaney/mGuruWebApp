“Of
course.
Climb
up,
little
girl,
but
I
can
only
take
you
up
to
the
trail.
After
that
you
are
on
your
own.
I
cannot
be
away
from
my
group
for
long,”
said
Hathi.
Bulbuli
was
relieved.
Her
small
legs
needed
rest
and
she
was
able
to
get
a
spectacular
view
of
the
jungle
from
atop
Hathi’s
back.
&nbsp;
Hathi,
like
Totaram,
had
many
tales
to
tell.
The
day
passed
easily.
At
dusk,
the
trio
settled
by
a
cave.
Totaram
and
Hathi
gathered
dried
leaves
and
straw
and
made
a
bed
for
Bulbuli.
As
soon
as
Bulbuli
lay
down,
she
dozed
off.
At
the
third
sunrise,
Totaram
did
not
have


to
wake
Bulbuli.
&nbsp;
She
was
up
at
the
crack
of
dawn.
Totaram
brought
her
some
purple
berries
this
time,
which
she
ate
with
delight.
The
young
girl,
the
parrot
and
the
elephant
began
the
last
leg
of
their
journey.
Bulbuli
was
becoming
more
uncertain
of
what
to
expect.
First
there
was
the
anticipation
of
Senseless
Point.
Then
there
was
the
uneasiness
of
the
jungles
at
war.
&nbsp;
As
she
was
getting
closer
to
her
destination,
her
heart
began
to
fill
with
thrill
and
excitement
but
with
a
tinge
of
apprehension.

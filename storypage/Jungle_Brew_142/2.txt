Waking
up
to
those
refreshing
scents
was
the
best
way
for
Bulbuli
to
begin
her
day.
Then
there
was
Totaram
the
parrot,
who
would
fly
in
to
the
village
every
morning,
perch
himself
atop
a
tree
facing
Bulbuli’s
hut,
and
tell
her
of
the
entire
buzz
in
the
forest.
He
would
also
tell
her
of
his
flights
to
different
lands
and
of
people
who
lived
there.
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
loved
to
hear
Totaram’s
tales.
She
longed
to
visit
these
lands
and
see
their
different
sights.
Her
heart
would
race
and
thump
loudly
as
Totaram
would
speak
but
it
would
always
end
with
a
deep
sigh.
She
had
to
stop
dreaming
of
faraway
lands
when
she
had
never
even
been
to
Senseless
Point.

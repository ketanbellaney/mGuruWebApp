Totaram
and
Bulbuli
carried
on
with
their
journey.
After
several
hours,
Bulbuli
grew
weary
and
exhausted.
However,
she
was
not
going
to
give
up.
She
had
an
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
here.
A
visit
to
Senseless
Point
for
people
around
her
village
was
like
a
pilgrimage.
 
Each
time
that
she
felt
fatigued,
Bulbuli
tried
to
picture
Senseless
Point
in
her
mind.
She
imagined
a
beautiful
place
that
could
fill
people’s
hearts
with
happiness.
That
scene
in
her
mind
was
enough
to
make
her
forget
how
footsore
she
was.
The
first
dusk
of
their
journey
set
in.
‘Another
day
to
go,’
thought
Bulbuli.
Bulbuli
rested
under
a
tree
while
Totaram
found
a
comfortable
spot
on
a
branch
above.
Soon
it
was
dawn.
 
Bulbuli
was
awakened
by
the
chattering
of
what
seemed
like
a
million
birds
in
the
jungle.
Bulbuli
took
several
big
breaths
and
stretched
her
arms
out
to
wake
up
her
body.
The
morning
felt
different.
She
could
smell
all
the
familiar
scents
that
she
used
to
every
morning,
but
somehow,
they
were
stronger
and
more
refreshing.

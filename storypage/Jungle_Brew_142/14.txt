Shortly,
Hathi
stopped.
He
said,
“It
is
time
for
me
to
say
goodbye.
I
must
return
to
my
family.
All
the
animals
will
be
grateful
to
you
if
you
could
help
end
the
war
of
the
jungles.
We
cannot
bear
to
live
anywhere
else.
These
jungles
have
been
our
home
for
generations.”
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
thanked
Hathi
for
carrying
her
as
far
as
he
did.


“I
hope
the
jungles
hear
me
out,
Hathi.
I
promise
to
do
my
best.”
Totaram
sat
on
Bulbuli’s
shoulder
and
asked
her
to
slow
down.
“Look
at
that
trail
going
downward.
That
will
lead
us
to
Senseless
Point,”
instructed
Totaram.
&nbsp;
At
this
point,
a
strange
humming
sound
enveloped
the
jungle.
As
they
walked
further,
the
noise
grew
louder
and
louder.
“Where
is
that
noise
coming
from?”
asked
Bulbuli
covering
her
ears.
&nbsp;
“That
is
the
sound
of
three
jungles
at
war,
and
it
is
only
going
to
get
louder
as
we
approach
Senseless
Point,”
hollered
Totaram.

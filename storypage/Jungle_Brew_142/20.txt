“My
mother
has
taught
me
important
things
from
the
Vedas.
Do
you
know
what
they
have
to
say?”
asked
Bulbuli.
“The
sun
should
be
a
giver
of
happiness,
the
sky
should
be
a
giver
of
happiness,
and
all
trees
and
plants
should
be
givers
of
happiness.
All
these
should
give
us
peace
of
mind.
Do
you
think
you
are
doing
that?”
&nbsp;
The
jungles
fell
silent.
They
were
listening
to
Bulbuli.
Bulbuli
had
an
idea.
She
whispered
something
to
Totaram.
He
flew
off
from
her
shoulder
almost
immediately.
&nbsp;
A
tulsi
plant
spoke.
“The
elaichi
and
tulsi
grow
wild.
We
have
no
control
over
where
and
how
we
grow.
And
neither
do
we
tell
the
wind
which
way
to
blow.”
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
thought
for
a
moment.
“In
that
case,
how
can
you
blame
the
tea?
Maybe
you
ought
to
blame
the
wind.”

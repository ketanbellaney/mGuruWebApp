Just
then
Bulbuli
realised
that
she
could
not
leave
without
telling
her
mother.
Totaram
suggested
that
they
stop
on
the
way
to
get
Koyal,
his
friend
to
tell
her
mother
first
thing
in
the
morning.
&nbsp;
“Hurry
now.
We
must
not
lose
any
time,”
Totaram
urged.
&nbsp;
So
off
they
went.
Totaram
flew
just
above
Bulbuli’s
head
and
led
the
way.
Bulbuli
walked
and
walked
for
several
hours.
She
was
not
unused
to
walking
through
thickets
and
tall
grass.
But
then
she
grew
hungry
and
tired.
Totaram
could
see
that
she
needed
to
eat
and
drink.
&nbsp;
“Just
a
little
longer
Bulbuli.
There
are
coconut
trees
up
ahead,”
said
Totaram.
When
they
reached
the
coconut
plantations,
Totaram
let
out
a
shrill
whistle.
“Whoeeeee…”
&nbsp;
From
nowhere
swung
a
frisky
monkey.
He
was
so
full
of
beans
that
Totaram
had
to
chide
him.
“Calm
down,
Bandaroo!
I
have
work
for
you.
Stop
prancing
around.”

Bulbuli
could
barely
believe
what
was
going
on.
Never
before
had
she
encountered
such
a
scene.
As
she
climbed
down
the
trail
and
looked
around,
she
saw
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary.
But
the
clamour
was
ear
splitting.
&nbsp;
Totaram
pecked
at
her
ear
to
get
her
attention.
With
the
shrieks
of
the
jungles,
Bulbuli
could
hardly
hear
Totaram.
With
three
more
steps,
Bulbuli
found
herself
amidst
a
clearing.
It
was
as
if
all
the
trees
of
the
jungle
had
suddenly
disappeared.
There
were
hillocks
stretching
as
far
as
her
eyes
could
see.
&nbsp;
“This
is
Senseless
Point.
This
is
a
place
where
everything
grows
wild.
Humans
hardly
ever
come
here,”
said
Totaram.
Then
Totaram
began
screaming,
“A
human
being
is
here,
a
human
being!”
But
in
the
deafening
din
of
the
jungles,
his
voice
went
unheard.
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
could
not
get
herself
to
remove
her
hands
from
her
ears.
She
could
not
understand
what
the
jungles
were
saying,
but
by
now
it
was
clear
that
there
were
three
jungles
involved.

Bulbuli
laughed
with
joy.
“You
can
now
wave
the
white
flag
for
peace.
I
have
a
bit
of
all
three
of
you
in
my
hand
and
together
you
smell
like
nothing
else
in
the
world.
One
whiff
of
all
of
you
together
is
so
relaxing.”
&nbsp;
Totatram
whispered
in
Bulbuli’s
ear.
She
smiled.
“Totaram
tells
me
that
the
animals
in
the
jungles
have
known
just
which
leaf
to
eat
when
they
are
unwell.
Even
the
birds
have
eaten
your
fruit
and
leaves
together
to
know
how
quickly
you
can
make
them
better
again.
Did
you
jungles
even
know
that?”
asked
Bulbuli.
&nbsp;
“These
animals
eat
your
leaves
to
relieve
all
kinds
of
sickness.
They
even
come
here
to
Senseless
Point
to
rejuvenate
themselves.
Totaram,
get
me
a
bunch
of
tea,
elaichi
and
tulsi.
I
am
going
back
home
to
brew
a
warm
cup
of
tea
with
tulsi
and
elaichi
for
my
mother.
Celebrate,
jungles!
The
world
is
going
to
know
how
well
you
taste
together.
Which
means
that
you
have
to
get
on
well
with
each
other.
Can
you
do
that?”
asked
Bulbuli.

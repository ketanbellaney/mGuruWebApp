A
gentle
breeze
pushed
her
to
her
left.
Her
head
turned
and
she
smiled
when
she
took
in
her
next
deep
breath.
It
was
an
attractive
and
pure
smell.
Instantly,
she
recognised
the
plant.
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
joined
her
hands
and
bowed
with
reverence.
“You
are
Tulsi!”
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
was
overwhelmed
by
the
fragrances.
They
smelled
like
three
octaves
of
the
same
musical
note
–
Sa,
Sa,
Sa.
Bulbuli
felt
joyful.
She
stretched
her
arms
and
twirled
around
with
her
eyes
closed.

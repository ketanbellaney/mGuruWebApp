Everybody
in
the
village
talked
of
Senseless
Point.
A
few
people
from
the
neighbouring
villages
had
been
there
but
no
one
from
her
own
village.
From
all
the
talk
around,
it
seemed
like
a
mysterious
place
promising
an
experience
of
a
lifetime.
Â 
Bulbuli
believed
that
if
she
ever
had
the
chance
to
go
to
Senseless
Point,
she
would
return
to
her
hamlet
and
describe
it
to
everyone.
She
would
tell
everyone
about
this
mysterious
place.

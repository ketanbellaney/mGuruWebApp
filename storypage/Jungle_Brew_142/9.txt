“Alright
Totaram.
What
is
it?”
asked
Bandaroo.
&nbsp;
“Pluck
a
couple
of
coconuts
and
toss
them
below.
My
friend
Bulbuli
here
is
hungry,”
informed
Totaram.
Bandaroo
obliged.
He
threw
three
green
coconuts
down.
They
split
open
as
they
crashed
to
the
ground.
Bulbuli
hungrily
reached
out
for
them
and
scooped
out
the
creamy
kernel.
She
ate
quickly
when
all
the
while
Bandaroo
squealed
with
delight
from
the
tree
above.&nbsp;


“Thanks
Bandaroo.
That
was
filling,”
said
Bulbuli.
&nbsp;
“Call
me
anytime
folks.
I’m
the
best
thrower
in
the
jungle,”
said
Bandaroo
chirpily.

“The
wind!
Tulsi
and
Elaichi
fight
constantly
with
the
wind
too.
They
do
not
want
the
wind
to
take
their
perfume
out
of
here,”
said
a
tea
bush.
Bulbuli
was
aghast.
“Is
that
true?”
she
asked.
&nbsp;
Neither
of
the
two
guilty
jungles
replied.
Bulbuli
sighed
deeply.
Just
then
Totaram
returned.
He
carried
a
few
tulsi
leaves,
some
elaichi
seeds
and
tea
leaves
in
his
beak
and
placed
them
on
Bulbuli’s
palm.
Bulbuli
gently
rubbed
them
together.
She
raised
her
palm
to
smell
them.
She
let
out
a
loud
delighted
shriek.
&nbsp;
The
jungles
screamed
back
in
unison,
“What
is
the
matter,
little
girl?
Are
you
all
right?”

Then
one
very
early
morning,
even
before
the
sun
had
risen,
she
heard
a
very
noisy
and
distressed
bird
call.
She
leapt
out
of
bed
and
rushed
out
to
look.
It
was
Totaram.
“Bulbuli!
Wake
up!
I
need
to
talk
to
you!”
&nbsp;
Bulbuli
stretched
out
her
arm
so
that
Totaram
could
perch
on
it.
“Where
have
you
been,
Totaram?
I
have
been
so
worried
about
you.
What
is
the
matter?
You
seem
very
upset!”
&nbsp;
“There
is
trouble
at
Senseless
Point.
War
has
broken
out
in
the
forest.”
“Calm
down
Totaram
or
you
will
wake
the
entire
village.
What
kind
of
trouble
are
you
talking
about?
And
who
is
at
war?”
asked
a
puzzled
Bulbuli.
&nbsp;
“The
jungle...
Oops!
Sorry,
Bulbuli.
I
do
need
to
stop
screaming.
The
jungles
are
at
war.
Senseless
Point
is
not
what
it
used
to
be.
All
the
animals
are
frightened.
They
do
not
know
what
is
going
to
happen
next.
Bulbuli,
we
have
to
think
of
something,”
cried
Totaram
anxiously.
&nbsp;
“I
still
do
not
understand.
How
can
jungles
be
at
war?
Why
don’t
you
take
me
to
Senseless
Point?”
said
Bulbuli.

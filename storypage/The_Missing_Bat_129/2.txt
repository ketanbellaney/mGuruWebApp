Rehman
Chacha
had
a
cricket
bat
factory
in
Sangam.
One
could
see
cricket
bats
neatly
stacked
in
rows
all
around
his
factory.

The
bats
were
made
from
willow
trees
that
make
the
best
quality
bats
in
the
world.
The
trees
grew
neatly
in
rows
on
both
sides
of
the
road
that
ran
through
Sangam.
In
fact,
you
can
see
them
all
over
Kashmir.

“Why
are
all
you
shameless
people
laughing?”
Rehman
Chacha
could
not
get
any
angrier
now.




“We
found
the
missing
cricket
bat,
Chacha!”
exclaimed
a
delighted
Aamir.
&nbsp;
Rehman
Chacha
was
astonished.
“But…but...but
you
have
all
been
standing
in
front
of
me.
How
did
you
find
it?
Where
is
it?”
asked
Rehman
Chacha.
&nbsp;
Everyone
looked
down
at
Rehman
Chacha’s
‘walking
stick’.
So
did
Rehman
Chacha.

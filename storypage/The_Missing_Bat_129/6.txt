Before
the
workers
left
for
home
each
evening,
Rehman
Chacha
would
count
the
number
of
bats
in
his
warehouse.
He
was
very
particular
about
his
stock.
If
he
found
a
bat
missing,
he
would
start
playing
detective.
&nbsp;
And
it
happened!
One
morning
when
Rehman
Chacha
opened
his
warehouse
to
take
the
stock
out
and
load
it
onto
his
truck,
he
found
that
there
was
one
bat
less.
That
too,
the
one
that
was
the
biggest
and
the
lightest!

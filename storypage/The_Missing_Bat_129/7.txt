&nbsp;
He
was
furious
and
ordered
all
his
men
to
stand
in
a
row.
“One
bat
is
missing.
Where
do
you
think
it
could
have
gone?”
&nbsp;
Everyone
looked
down
and
shook
their
heads.
They
found
it
difficult
to
look
at
Chacha
when
he
was
angry.
&nbsp;
“How
can
a
bat
disappear
overnight?
No
one
else
enters
the
warehouse
other
than
you
all
and
me,”
screamed
Rehman
Chacha
as
everyone
continued
looking
down.

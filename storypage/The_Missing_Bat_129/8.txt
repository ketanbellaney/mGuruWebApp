&nbsp;
Just
then
Rehman
Chacha
laid
his
eyes
on
Aamir.
“Aha!
Where
is
Ahmed,
Aamir?
He
is
not
to
be
seen
today.”
&nbsp;
“Ahmed
is
not
keeping
too
well,
Rehman
Chacha.
He
is
down
with
a
cold
and
cough,”
Aamir
answered,
still
looking
down.
&nbsp;
Suddenly,
one
by
one
everyone
started
giggling
and
then
laughing,
including
Aamir.

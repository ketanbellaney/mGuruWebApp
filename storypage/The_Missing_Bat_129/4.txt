&nbsp;
&nbsp;Aamir
worked
at
Rehman
Chacha's
factory.
His
son,
Ahmed,
stayed
with
him
at
the
factory
every
day
after
school.
He
would
stare
at
the
tall
stacks
of
cricket
bats
in
awe.




On
several
evenings,
after
the
sun
had
set,
he
would
see
the
moon
partly
hidden
behind
the
stack
of
bats
and
wonder
if
he
could
touch
the
moon
if
he
ever
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
a
stack.

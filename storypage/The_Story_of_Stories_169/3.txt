‘BREAKING
NEWS’
stories
are
about
anger
and
fear
and
hate
and
greed,
and
there
was
none
of
that
in
the
Forest.
Everything
was
happy,
happy,
happy.

A
journalist
bear
without
a
‘BREAKING
NEWS’
story
doesn’t
deserve
to
be
a
journalist
bear,
thought
Bear
sadly
to
himself.
He
should
be
a
Waiter
Bear,
or
a
Sweeper
Bear,
or
a
Telephone
Voice
Bear,
saying,
‘Please
check
the
number
you
have
dialled’,
or
‘Kindly
wait
-
you
are
in
a
queue’.

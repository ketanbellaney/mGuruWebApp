“Arrey
oh
Journalist
Bear!”
said
Sardarji.
“Going
somewhere?”




“Don’t
call
me
that
or
I
will
cry,”
said
Bear,
and
told
Sardarji
he
was
leaving
to
become
a
Telephone
Voice
Bear.
&nbsp;
“Don’t
be
such
a
silly
bear,
Bear!”
scolded
Sardarji.
He
pulled
out
a
guitar
and
began
to
sing.


“If
Tweety
birds
stop
tweeting,


and
Hooty
Owls
stop
hooting,


the
world
would
be
a
sad
playyyy-ce,


don’t
you
see?”

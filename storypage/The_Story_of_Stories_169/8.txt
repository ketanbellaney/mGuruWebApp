Bear
beamed.
Sardarji
was
right!
He
really
WAS
a
Writer
Bear.
&nbsp;
“Tell
you
what,
Bear,”
Sardarji
went
on,
“let’s
travel
the
world,
you
and
I.
I
will
sing,
and
you,
Bear,
will
write.
Not
'BREAKING
NEWS'
stories
-
no
one
remembers
those
after
three
days,
anyway
-
but
real
stories
of
real
people,
stories
that
will
never
grow
old.”
&nbsp;
“Hurray!”
said
Bear.

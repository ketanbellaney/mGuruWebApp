Excuse
me!
you
say.
That
can’t
be
true.
There’s
NEVER
a
time
when
EVERY
creature
ANYwhere
is
happy,
happy,
happy.
&nbsp;
Hmmm.
Maybe
you’re
right.
Maybe
not
EVERY
creature
was
happy.
This
journalist
bear,
for
instance.




In
this
picture,
Bear
is
trying
to
smile,
but
he
has
a
great
sorrow.
He
simply
cannot
find
a
‘BREAKING
NEWS’
story.
He
even
sent
Bird
to
look
-
because
Bird
moves
faster
and
sees
better
-
but
Bird
came
back
with
nothing.

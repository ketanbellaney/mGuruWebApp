And
that
was
how
Writer
Bear
and
Singing
Sardarji
set
out
to
explore
the
world.




Everywhere
they
went,
Sardarji
sang
to
the
people,
and
Bear
listened
to
them.
Over
time,
Bear
wrote
many,
many
stories.
Happy
stories
that
made
people
cry,
funny
stories
that
made
them
think,
sad
stories
that
made
them
hope,
and
scary
stories
that
made
them
laugh.
&nbsp;
And
Storyweavers
all
over
the
world
picked
up
the
long,
strong,
shining
threads
of
Bear's
stories,
and
wove
them
into
new
and
wonderful
stories
for
all
of
us
to
enjoy.

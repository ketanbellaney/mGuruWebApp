It
was
a
beautiful
summer
day
in
the
Forest-By-The-Sea
in
the
glorious
land
of
Somewheristan.
Whales
danced
in
the
waves,
singing
to
each
other.
Sea
lions,
their
smooth
brown
bodies
glistening
in
the
sun,
played
peek-a-boo
with
the
noisy
seagulls,
barking
and
scolding.




Every
creature
in
the
Forest
was
happy,
happy,
happy.

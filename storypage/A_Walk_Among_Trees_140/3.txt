Pomegranate
juice
is
very
tasty
and
is
taken
to
bring
down
fever.
Pomegranates
contain
plenty
of
natural
sugars
and
vitamin
C.
The
dried
seeds
are
made
into
sour
anardana,
which
is
a
spice
used
to
flavour
pakoras
and
aloo
paranthas.
The
rind
of
the
pomegranate
is
dried
and
powdered
and
taken
to
cure
an
upset
stomach.
&nbsp;
Pomegranates
are
called
anar
in
Hindi.
One
of
the
most
renowned
dancers
in
the
court
of
Mughal
emperor
Akbar
was
called
Anarkali&nbsp;—
bud
of
the
anar&nbsp;—
because
she
was
so
beautiful.
&nbsp;
Some
pomegranates
are
called
kandhari,
as
once
they
were
only
grown
in
a
place
called
Kandahar,
in
Afghanistan.

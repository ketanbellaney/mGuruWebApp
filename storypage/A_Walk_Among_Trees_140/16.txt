“Father,
why
are
these
trees
so
special
to
you?”
asked
the
prince.
“Son,
these
trees
grow
in
different
parts
of
India
and
during
my
travels
to
different
states,
I
have
chosen
the
most
delicious
fruit
trees
of
those
regions.
They
all
need
different
kinds
of
climate
to
survive.
But,
here,
our
soil
is
so
rich
and
our
gardeners
so
dedicated,
that
they
have
been
able
to
raise
all
these
trees.
Look
at
this
one.
It
is
a
ber
tree.”

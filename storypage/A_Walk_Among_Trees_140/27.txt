There
are
thousands
of
different
types
of
trees
but
the
ones
that
give
us
delicious
fruit
are
the
best
of
them
all.
All
trees
bear
fruit.
However,
all
fruits
are
not
edible.
Some
may
even
be
poisonous!
 
But
trees
are
our
special
friends.
They
give
us
shade
on
a
hot
day;
they
provide
us
with
food,
timber
and
medicines.
When
trees
grow
over
a
large
area,
they
form
forests.
Forests
affect
the
climate
of
a
place,
prevent
soil
erosion
and
provide
a
habitat
for
a
variety
of
animals.
 
We
must
look
after
trees
and
plant
trees
if
we
can,
so
that
we
have
a
healthy
environment.

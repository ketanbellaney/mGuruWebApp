Guava
&nbsp;
Guavas
are
really
delicious!
Ripe
yellow
ones
are
tasty,
but
the
crunchy
green
ones
are
mouth-watering
too,
especially
when
sprinkled
with
salt
and
masala.
&nbsp;
Have
you
seen
a
guava
tree?
It
is
not
very
tall,
possibly
as
tall
as
a
single
storeyed
house.
The
trunk
is
slender
with
a
grey-ochre
bark
that
peels
off
in
strips.
The
leaves
are
oval
and
rough
to
touch.
The
tree
is
full
of
beautiful,
five-petalled
white
flowers,
towards
the
end
of
winter
and
then
again
at
the
time
of
the
rains.
&nbsp;
When
these
flowers
fall,
small
green
guavas
begin
to
appear.
At
first,
the
fruit
is
green
and
hard.
As
it
ripens,
it
becomes
softer
and
the
colour
becomes
a
creamy
gold.
&nbsp;
The
flesh
is
white
and
in
the
centre,
there
are
lots
of
woody
seeds.
Some
guavas
have
pink
flesh.
These
are
also
very
tasty.
Another
type
of
guava
is
deep
red
on
the
outside.

Chikoo
&nbsp;
When
round,
brown
chikoos
grow
on
trees,
they
remind
us
of
soft,
brown
balls.
The
skin
is
a
bit
fuzzy,
and
the
brownish
flesh
within
is
very
sweet
and
has
a
grainy
texture.
The
chikoo
has
shiny,
long,
black
seeds
inside.
The
leaves
of
the
tree
are
longish
and
glossy.
The
tree
can
reach
a
height
of
about
10
metres.
&nbsp;
This
tree
was
brought
from
South
America
many
years
ago
where
the
Aztec
Indians
called
the
tree
Chicle.
They
tapped
the
bark
for
the
rubbery
gum
that
oozes
out
of
it
and
made
an
ancient
chewing
gum
from
it.
This
is
how
the
idea
of
making
chewing
gum
came
to
people's
minds
in
modern
times.
The
word
chikoo
comes
from
chicle.
Chikoos
grow
best
in
warm
and
humid
places.
The
best
chikoos
come
from
Maharashtra
and
central
India.
In
some
parts
of
the
world,
the
chikoo
is
known
as
the
Sapodilla.
&nbsp;
This
fruit
has
a
very
high
sugar
content.
It
also
has
a
good
amount
of
vitamin
C.
In
some
places,
the
seeds
are
made
into
a
paste
to
cure
insect
bites
and
stings.
Chikoo
ice
cream
is
delicious.

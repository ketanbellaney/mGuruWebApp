This
tree
is
originally
from
India.
The
name
jamun,
comes
from
the
word
Jambu
Dweep,
as
India
was
once
known
in
the
olden
days,
since
it
was
supposed
to
be
full
of
jamun
trees!
 
Ripe
jamuns
are
very
tasty
when
they
are
eaten
with
rock
salt.
 
In
the
forests
when
wild
jamuns
fall
from
the
tree
they
are
eaten
by
bears,
deer,
monkeys
and
other
small
animals.
 
The
bark
and
seeds
of
the
jamun
are
dried
and
powdered
and
then
used
as
a
medicine
for
diabetes.
The
fruit
is
rich
in
fruit
sugar,
iron
and
vitamin
C.

Tamarind
is
very
rich
in
iron
and
vitamin
C.
The
seeds
are
dried
and
powdered
and
can
be
used
as
a
flour.
Tender
tamarind
leaves
and
tamarind
flowers
are
also
used
in
cooking.
&nbsp;
The
tree
gives
very
dense
shade
in
summer.
There
are
many
superstitions
in
India
about
the
tamarind
tree.
People
believe
that
ghosts
live
on
its
branches
and
that
one
must
not
sleep
under
it
at
night.
&nbsp;
If
you
look
closely
at
the
leaves
of
a
tamarind
tree
at
night,
you
will
notice
that
they
fold
up.
Of
course,
the
truth
is
that,
because
the
big
tree
breathes
out
carbon
dioxide,
it
is
not
healthy
to
sleep
under
it
at
night.
It
is
thought
that
many,
many
years
ago,
the
tree
was
brought
from
Africa.
It
began
to
grow
very
well
in
this
country
and
now
it
is
very
hard
to
believe
that
it
came
from
another
country.

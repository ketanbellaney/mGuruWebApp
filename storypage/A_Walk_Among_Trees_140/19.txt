The
leaves
are
dark
green
and
glossy.
If
you
crush
a
leaf
between
your
fingers,
it
has
a
strong
tangy
smell.
If
you
sit
near
flowering
orange
trees,
the
perfume
is
very
soothing.
That
is
why
the
flowers
are
dried
and
then
stuffed
into
pillows
for
a
good
beauty
sleep.
 
The
rind
of
the
orange
is
dried
and
mixed
with
gram
flour
to
make
a
scrub
for
the
skin.
This
can
be
used
instead
of
soap.
In
the
olden
days,
ladies
in
China
carried
oranges
in
their
hands
to
keep
them
smelling
sweet.
 
It
is
thought
that
the
orange
tree
came
from
the
southern
parts
of
China.
Some
people
think
that
its
origin
lies
in
the
foothills
of
the
Himalayas.

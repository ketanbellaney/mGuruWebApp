Trees
are
the
tallest
of
all
plants
in
the
world
and
they
were
present
on
the
earth
much
before
human
beings
appeared.
&nbsp;
Trees
grow
on
mountains,
along
seashores
and
in
hot
deserts.
We
find
them
growing
along
the
edges
of
roads,
in
fields
and
in
our
homes
and
gardens.
All
plants
and
trees
are
necessary
for
life
on
earth
as
they
provide
oxygen
that
living
beings
need
to
survive.
&nbsp;
Most
plants
have
a
green
colouring
matter
in
their
leaves
called
chlorophyll.
During
the
day,
when
sunlight
falls
on
the
leaves,
the
leaves
prepare
food
for
the
plants
by
a
process
called
photosynthesis.
They
do
this
with
the
help
of
the
water
absorbed
by
the
roots,
the
carbon
dioxide
from
the
air
that
enters
the
leaves
through
tiny
pores
on
the
surface
of
the
leaf,
and
sunlight.
Oxygen
is
let
out
into
the
air
as
a
result
of
photosynthesis.

Coconut
&nbsp;
Graceful
coconut
trees
grow
in
sandy
soil,
in
the
tropics
where
the
weather
is
warm
and
wet.
Coastal
areas
have
the
largest
number
of
coconut
trees.
This
tall
tree
has
a
slim
trunk,
which
bends
with
the
strong
breeze
that
blows
in
coastal
areas.
Because
it
bends,
it
does
not
break.
&nbsp;
The
water
inside
green
coconuts
is
very
tasty
and
nutritious.
It
has
sugar,
protein,
amino
acids,
and
minerals
like
calcium,
iron
and
copper,
and
vitamins.
As
the
fruit
becomes
ripe,
it
turns
brown
and
hard
and
the
water
inside
becomes
sweeter,
until
it
is
quite
dry.
Coconut
oil
is
extracted
from
the
flesh
when
the
nut
turns
brown
and
woody.
&nbsp;
Each
coconut
leaf
has
a
long
central
rib
with
smaller
hard
leaves
growing
on
either
side.
Waving
in
the
breeze,
coconut
leaves
resemble
the
feathers
of
some
giant
bird.
The
leaves
are
plaited
to
make
baskets
and
mats,
and
also
to
make
thatched
roofs.
The
hollowed
out
trunk
is
used
as
boats.

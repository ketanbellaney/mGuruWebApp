Orange
&nbsp;
We
all
wait
for
juicy
oranges
in
the
beginning
of
winter.
The
tangy
smell
of
a
peeled
orange
is
unmistakable.
It
comes
from
the
oil
in
the
rind.
The
orange
is
easy
to
eat
because
it
can
be
peeled
and
each
section
eaten
separately.
It
is
also
a
great
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day.
&nbsp;
Oranges
are
full
of
vitamin
C,
which
keeps
colds
and
coughs
away.
They
also
have
calcium
which
is
good
for
strong
bones.
Orange
juice
is
a
popular
drink
and
the
flavour
of
oranges
is
used
in
many
food
products.
&nbsp;
The
best
oranges
in
India
come
from
Nagpur.
The
trees
are
about
six
metres
tall,
and
somewhat
thorny.

Jamun
The
jamun
tree
is
tall
and
graceful,
with
a
grey-brown
bark
and
deep
green,
long
oval
pointed
leaves.
The
trees
always
have
dense
foliage.
They
grow
about
12
metres
tall.
Children
love
to
play
beneath
their
deep
shade.
The
bark
is
smooth
but
the
wood
is
weak
so
the
trees
are
not
very
safe
to
climb.
&nbsp;
From
March
to
May,
the
tree
is
full
of
bunches
of
tiny
creamy
flowers,
which
bees
and
other
insects
love
for
their
nectar.
We
all
wait
for
the
rains,
when
the
jamun
gives
delicious,
deep
purple
fruit
with
a
stone
in
the
centre.
The
ripe
fruit
is
sweet-sour
and
good
to
eat.
Ask
any
parrot
or
squirrel,
or
even
fruit
bats
that
come
to
eat
the
juicy
berries
at
night!
&nbsp;
Jamun
trees
often
grow
wild
in
forests
and
according
to
Hindu
legend,
Krishna
loved
to
eat
the
fruit
when
he
grazed
his
cows.
The
dark
purple
colour
of
the
fruit
is
supposed
to
be
the
same
colour
as
Krishna's
complexion.
Lord
Ganesh
is
supposed
to
love
this
fruit
too.
The
tree
is
also
sacred
to
Shiva
and
Vishnu.

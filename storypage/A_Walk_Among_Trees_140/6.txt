Papaya
&nbsp;
When
we
cut
open
a
golden
orange
papaya,
we
find
a
lot
of
shiny,
black
seeds
that
look
like
whole
black
pepper.
Can
you
imagine
how
many
trees
can
grow
from
each
fruit
—
at
least
500!
But
not
all
the
trees
that
grow
from
the
seeds
will
give
us
fruit.
This
is
because
some
trees
have
flowers
that
are
male
and
other
trees
have
flowers
that
are
female.
&nbsp;
When
we
plant
many
papaya
trees
together,
it
ensures
that
cross-pollination
takes
place
and
the
‘female’
trees
bear
fruit.
The
fragrance
of
papaya
flowers
is
very
sweet.
Insects
and
birds
help
in
pollination
and
little
papaya
fruits
begin
to
form.

Guavas
that
ripen
in
the
winter
are
always
tastier
than
those
found
during
the
rest
of
the
year.
In
India,
Allahabadi
guavas
are
famous
for
their
taste.
 
There
are
so
many
guava
trees
in
India
that
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
they
came
from
Brazil
in
South
America.
Sailors
travelling
from
those
parts,
brought
the
seeds
of
guavas
with
them.
 
Parrots
and
monkeys
love
guavas.
It
is
believed
that
a
guava
pecked
by
a
parrot
will
be
sweet! 
Guavas
are
very
good
for
us
as
they
are
full
of
vitamin
A
and
C.
The
tree
has
other
uses
too.
The
leaves
are
mashed
and
used
to
relieve
toothache.
The
bark
is
used
to
make
a
dye
for
colouring
silk.

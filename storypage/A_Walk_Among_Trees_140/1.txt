The
royal
orchard
looked
lush
after
the
rains.
The
earth
was
soft
and
wet
and
had
a
delightful
fragrance.
The
trees
looked
like
they
had
been
washed
and
each
leaf
looked
like
it
had
been
polished
by
hand.
&nbsp;
The
head
gardener
was
getting
a
new
tree
planted.
He
directed
his
helpers
to
a
pit
that
had
been
prepared
just
that
morning.
The
young
tree
was
carefully
lowered.
All
along,
the
head
gardener
kept
saying,
“I
will
lose
my
job
and
all
of
you
will
rot
in
the
darkest
chambers
of
the
palace
if
this
tree
does
not
survive.
And
if
it
blooms,
you
won’t
have
to
work
another
day
in
your
life.
You
will
all
be
handsomely
rewarded.”


&nbsp;As
an
offering
to
Mother
Earth,
he
threw
in
sugar
cane
juice,
before
the
roots
of
the
young
tree
were
patted
with
mud.
Just
then
the
King
and
his
young
prince
stepped
into
the
orchard.
&nbsp;
This
was
to
be
the
first
walk
among
the
trees
for
the
prince
with
his
father.
“Father,
what
is
this
sapling?”
asked
the
prince,
pointing
to
a
plant.
“It
is
a
pomegranate
sapling.
The
tree
that
will
have
the
most
beautiful
flowers...”
&nbsp;The
prince
watched
his
father
admiring
the
trees
around
them
with
love
and
care.

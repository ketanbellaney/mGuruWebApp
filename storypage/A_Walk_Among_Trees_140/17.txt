Ber
&nbsp;
Sometimes
on
the
way
to
school
or
walking
around
the
edges
of
fields,
we
come
across
ber
bushes.
They
are
thorny,
but
the
little
red
fruit
with
a
stone
in
the
centre
is
worth
plucking
because
it
is
very
tasty.
&nbsp;
There
are
many
different
types
of
bers,
some
grow
on
trees
with
graceful,
drooping
branches
whereas
others
grow
on
bushes.
Some
are
round
and
others
have
a
longish
shape,
but
they
all
have
a
wonderful
flavour.
Ber
trees
can
be
about
six
metres
tall
and
the
bushes
are
only
about
one
metre
high.
The
ber
tree
and
the
ber
bush
are
both
thorny.
The
trees
have
longer
thorns
and
that
is
why
when
bers
are
ripe,
people
take
a
long
stick
with
a
sharp
knife
at
the
end
of
it,
to
cut
down
ripe
bers.
Sometimes,
if
the
branch
is
shaken
hard,
the
ripe
fruit
drops
down
and
can
be
collected.
Ber
trees
grow
in
dry
places
where
it
does
not
rain
too
much.
The
leaves
are
eaten
by
goats,
camels
and
cattle.
&nbsp;
Silkworms
also
eat
the
leaves
of
the
ber.
Another
very
interesting
insect
called
the
lac
insect
lives
on
the
branches
of
the
ber.
The
insect
sucks
the
juice
and
secretes
a
red
substance
called
lac,
from
which
paints,
varnishes
and
dyes
are
made.

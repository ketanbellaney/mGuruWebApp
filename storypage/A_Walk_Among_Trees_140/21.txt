Tamarind
&nbsp;
The
tamarind
tree
grows
to
a
height
of
over
20
metres.
It
has
a
long
straight
trunk
with
dark
brown
bark.
The
branches
are
strong
and
supple
and
droop
downwards.
The
tiny
leaves
are
of
a
fresh
green
colour
and
form
graceful,
feathery
foliage.
They
are
also
sour
like
the
tamarind
and
are
nice
to
eat.
&nbsp;
The
tamarind
has
beautiful
yellow
flowers
with
thin
streaks
of
red.
When
the
flower
dries
up,
its
place
is
taken
by
a
tamarind
pod.
The
pod
is
green
and
gradually
turns
a
light
brown
as
it
ripens.
It
is
like
suede
to
touch.
&nbsp;
When
it
ripens
in
winter,
it
becomes
a
deep
brown
and
the
pulp
inside
is
sour
with
a
hint
of
sweetness.
Tamarind
seeds
are
dark
brown
and
enclosed
inside
the
pulp.
Squirrels
and
birds
love
to
eat
ripe
tamarind.
Children
also
love
raw
tamarind
dipped
in
rock
salt,
though
it
can
give
them
a
sore
throat
sometimes.
&nbsp;
Tamarind
is
used
to
make
delicious
curries,
pickles,
chutneys
and
tangy
jal
jeera,
which
is
not
only
cooling
in
Summer,
but
also
delicious
with
gol
gappas.

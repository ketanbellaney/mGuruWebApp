Banana
&nbsp;
Some
banana
trees
are
as
tall
as
a
single-storeyed
house
while
others
are
only
as
tall
as
a
person.
The
leaves
are
sometimes
one-and-a-half
metres
long
and
over
half
a
metre
broad,
with
a
thick
rib
running
through
the
centre.
&nbsp;
The
new
leaves
have
a
fresh
green
colour
but
as
they
grow
older,
they
become
darker
and
get
torn
at
the
edges.
The
trunk
of
the
banana
has
no
bark.
It
is
actually
a
thick
stem
made
of
the
stems
of
the
leaves
that
are
tightly
wound
around
each
other.
&nbsp;
The
flowers
of
the
banana
tree
grow
inside
a
reddish
cone.
Hundreds
of
tiny
white
flowers
can
be
found
inside
each
cone.
As
many
as
a
hundred
bananas
can
grow
together
in
a
bunch.
When
the
bananas
are
almost
ripe,
the
bunch
is
cut
down
and
left
to
ripen.

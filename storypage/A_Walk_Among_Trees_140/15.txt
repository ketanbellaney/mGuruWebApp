It
is
amazing
that
even
the
husk,
that
encloses
the
shell
of
the
coconut,
is
used
for
making
ropes,
mats,
brushes
and
to
stuff
mattresses.
&nbsp;
All
over
the
world,
the
coconut
tree
is
prized
for
its
different
uses.
Sometimes
it
is
known
as
the
tree
of
heaven.
It
is
supposed
to
have
come
from
the
Melanesian
islands
in
the
Pacific
Ocean.
&nbsp;
If
you
had
no
other
tree
but
the
coconut,
you
could
build
a
house,
have
a
meal
and
a
cool
drink,
make
clothes
from
leaves,
make
a
broom
and
even
have
a
soft
mattress
to
sleep
on!
Can
you
think
of
any
other
uses?
&nbsp;
The
coconut
is
a
symbol
of
prosperity.

Pomegranate
&nbsp;
It
is
hard
to
say
which
is
more
beautiful
-&nbsp;
a
pomegranate
fruit
or
the
brilliant
red
flower.
The
fruit
has
a
deep
red
colour
and
is
the
size
of
a
cricket
ball.
&nbsp;
It
has
leathery
skin
and
when
it
is
opened,
you
find
many
red,
juicy
seeds,
which
look
as
though
they
are
made
of
glass.
Each
seed
has
a
woody,
crunchy
centre.
Some
fruits
are
yellowish
pink
and
have
pink
seeds.
These
are
also
very
tasty.
&nbsp;
The
pomegranate
tree
grows
to
about
three
metres.
The
long
and
narrow
leaves
are
shiny
and
the
branches
have
a
few
thorns.
In
the
spring,
the
tree
is
covered
with
scarlet
flowers.
The
petals
look
as
though
they
are
made
of
crinkly
paper.
&nbsp;
These
flowers
have
no
smell.
The
petals
grow
out
of
a
red
part
called
the
calyx.
After
the
petals
fall,
the
calyx
begins
to
grow
bigger
and
bigger
till
it
becomes
a
pomegranate
with
a
crown.

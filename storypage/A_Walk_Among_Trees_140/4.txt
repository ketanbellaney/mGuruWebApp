Jackfruit
&nbsp;
The
jackfruit
grows
on
a
tall
tree
with
a
thick
foliage
of
dark
green
leaves.
The
jackfruit
does
not
grow
just
on
the
branches
like
other
fruit,
but
also
on
the
tree
trunk.
&nbsp;
Another
amazing
fact
is
that
when
the
jackfruit
tree
turns
very
old,
the
fruit
can
also
grow
on
those
roots
which
come
out
above
the
ground.
&nbsp;
The
large,
oblong
fruits
can
sometimes
weigh
as
much
as
40
kilograms.
Their
rough
skins
are
covered
with
conical
studs.
When
jackfruits
are
young
they
are
green
and
eaten
as
a
vegetable,
but
when
they
are
ripe
and
turn
yellowish-brown
they
are
eaten
as
a
fruit.
The
ripe
fruit
has
a
strong
characteristic
smell
and
not
everyone
likes
it.

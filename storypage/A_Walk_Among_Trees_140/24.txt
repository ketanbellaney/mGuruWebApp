Mango
Who
doesn't
love
delicious
mangoes!
They
are
equally
tasty,
whether
they
are
ripe
and
golden
or
green
and
sour
when
they
are
raw
and
eaten
with
a
bit
of
salt.
We
all
wait
eagerly
for
the
summer
season
when
the
mango
fruit
ripens.
It
has
been
rightly
called
the
king
of
fruits
in
India.
&nbsp;
There
are
many
types
of
mangoes.
Some
are
big
and
yellow
and
can
weigh
almost
a
kilogram;
others
are
tiny,
green
and
juicy
and
have
to
be
sucked
to
be
really
enjoyed.


You
can
throw
a
whole
lot
of
mangoes
in
a
bucket
of
ice
water
and
when
they
are
cool,
sit
under
a
tree
and
enjoy
them.
It
is
a
good
practice
to
wear
old
clothes
and
eat
mangoes
because
their
juice
can
ruin
clothes.
&nbsp;
In
India,
we
have
more
than
a
thousand
different
varieties
of
mangoes.
Wild
mango
trees
originally
grew
in
the
Himalayan
foothills
and
spread
from
there
to
the
rest
of
the
world.
The
mango
tree
is
about
15
metres
tall.
Old
trees
can
sometimes
grow
up
to
30
metres.
Some
mango
trees
in
orchards
are
just
about
three
metres
tall.

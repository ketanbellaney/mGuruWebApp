The
tree
has
big
leaves
that
are
thickly
veined.
When
they
dry,
they
fall
off
leaving
a
scar
on
the
trunk.
The
wood
of
the
trunk
is
not
hard.
It
is
soft
inside,
rather
like
the
stem
of
a
big
plant.
 
Papayas
are
very
nutritious,
with
lots
of
vitamin
C
and
A,
and
calcium
too.
Raw
papayas
are
used
as
a
tasty
vegetable.
Papayas
have
an
enzyme
called
papain,
which
is
useful
for
digestion.
Raw
papaya
helps
in
tenderizing
meat.
 
Ripe
papaya
pulp
is
good
for
skin
problems
and
is
used
to
get
rid
of
spots
and
blemishes
on
the
skin.
Papayas
came
from
Mexico
and
Central
America.
But
they
are
seen
almost
everywhere
in
India!

"
Amma,
I
want
a
new
kind
of
celebration
said
Mili
to
her
mother.


&nbsp;Amma
looked
at
her
older
brother
and
they
smiled
as
they
had
decided
that
this
time
it
will
not
be
the
cakes,
balloons,
or
the
usual
decorations.&nbsp;


&nbsp;This
time
Mili
will
have
her
home
decorated
like
it
is
done
for
Deepavali,
just
as
Mili
finds
it
the
happiest
festival
in
the
year.&nbsp;

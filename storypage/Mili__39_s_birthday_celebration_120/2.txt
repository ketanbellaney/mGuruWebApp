Soon
Anna
(older
brother)
got
ready
with
the
decorations
of
putting
a
new
toran
at
the
door,
flowers
strung
on
the
walls,
windows
and
Amma
started
keeping
the
diya's
ready
for
the
evening.&nbsp;

As
the
clock
struck
6'o
clock
in
the
evening
her
home
was
looking
beautiful
as
though
it
was
Deepavali
on
her
birthday.
&nbsp;Suddenly
she
saw
the
entire&nbsp;neighborhood&nbsp;were
lighting
diyas
and
children
were
getting
ready
to
come
to
Mili's
house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

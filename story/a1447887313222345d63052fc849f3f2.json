    "\ufeffMango immediately made up his mind, \"I'll play the part of the tree.\" Suddenly a storm broke. The lights became dim. Mango quietly slipped on to the stage. A man with glasses ran up and bumped straight into Mango. \"Where the devil did this tree come from?\" he asked angrily. Everyone was taken aback. They could not understand how the tree came to be there. \"The tree is needed for the first scene but how will we get rid of it afterwards.\" Someone suggested, \"Cut it down.\" Some boys began to throw stones at the mangoes. The lamps broke and the stage was plunged in darkness. Mango stepped off the stage as stealthily as he had stepped on to it.\n"
